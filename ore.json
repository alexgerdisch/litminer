    "abstract": "Genetic variation is known to contribute to the variation of animal social behavior, but the molecular mechanisms that lead to behavioral differences are still not fully understood. Here, we investigate the cellular evolution of the hypothalamic medial preoptic area (MPOA), a brain region that plays a critical role in social behavior, across two sister species of deer mice ( and ) with divergent social systems. These two species exhibit large differences in mating and parental care behavior across species and sex. Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we build a cellular atlas of the MPOA for males and females of both  species. We identify four cell types that are differentially abundant across species, two of which may account for species differences in parental care behavior. Our data further implicate two sex-biased cell types to be important for the evolution of sex-specific behavior. Finally, we show a remarkable reduction of sex-biased gene expression in , a monogamous species that also exhibits reduced sexual dimorphism in parental care behavior. Our MPOA atlas is a powerful resource to investigate how molecular neuronal traits may be evolving to give rise to innate differences in social behavior across animal species.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor. GBM has an extremely poor prognosis and new treatments are badly needed. Efficient drug delivery to GBM is a major obstacle as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents passage of the majority of cancer drugs into the brain. It is also recognized that the blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB) in the growing tumor represents a challenge. The BTB is heterogeneous and poorly characterized, but similar to the BBB it can prevent therapeutics from reaching effective intra-tumoral doses, dramatically hindering their potential. Here, we identified a 12-gene signature associated with the BTB, with functions related to vasculature development, morphogenesis and cell migration. We identified CDH5 as a core molecule in this set and confirmed its over-expression in GBM vasculature using spatial transcriptomics of GBM patient specimens. We found that the indirubin-derivative, 6-bromoindirubin acetoxime (BIA), could downregulate CDH5 and other BTB signature genes, causing endothelial barrier disruption in endothelial monolayers and BBB 3D spheroids . Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with BIA enabled increased intra-tumoral accumulation of the BBB non-penetrant chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin and potentiated cisplatin-mediated DNA damage by targeting DNA repair pathways. Finally, using an injectable BIA nanoparticle formulation, PPRX-1701, we significantly improved the efficacy of cisplatin in patient-derived GBM xenograms and prolonged their survival. Overall, our work reveals potential targets at the BTB for improved chemotherapy delivery and the bifunctional properties of BIA as a BTB modulator and potentiator of chemotherapy, supporting its further development.",

However, due to the resource constraints and technical challenges associated with the single-cell experiments, researchers can only profile gene expression at discrete and sparsely sampled timepoints. This missing timepoint information impedes downstream cell developmental analyses. We propose scNODE, an end-to-end deep learning model that can predict in silico single-cell gene expression at unobserved timepoints. scNODE integrates a variational autoencoder with neural ordinary differential equations to predict gene expression using a continuous and nonlinear latent space. Importantly, we incorporate a dynamic regularization term to learn a latent space that is robust against distribution shifts when predicting single-cell gene expression at unobserved timepoints. Our evaluations on three real-world scRNA-seq datasets show that scNODE achieves higher predictive performance than state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate that scNODE's predictions help cell trajectory inference under the missing timepoint paradigm and the learned latent space is useful for in silico perturbation analysis of relevant genes along a developmental cell path.",

One key novelty is the fused rod at the end of the vertebral column in anurans, the urostyle. This feature is composed of a coccyx and a hypochord, both of which ossify during metamorphosis. To elucidate the genetic basis of these features, we used laser capture microdissection of these tissues and did RNA-seq and ATAC-seq at three developmental stages in tadpoles of . RNA-seq reveals that the coccyx and hypochord have two different molecular signatures. Neuronal () and muscle markers () are upregulated in coccygeal tissues, whereas T-box genes (, ), corticosteroid stress hormones () and matrix metallopeptidases (,  and ) are upregulated in the hypochord. ATAC-seq reveals potential regulatory regions that are observed in proximity to candidate genes that regulate ossification identified from RNA-seq. Even though an ossifying hypochord is only present in anurans, this ossification between the vertebral column and the notochord resembles a congenital vertebral anomaly seen prenatally in humans caused by an ectopic expression of the / gene. This work opens the way to functional studies that can elucidate anuran  evolution.",

Past work has shown that  responds to β-lactam treatment differently depending on the metabolic environment both  and . Studies of other bacteria show that an increase in respiratory metabolism independent of growth rate promotes susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics. We propose that  enters a protected state linked to an increase in polysaccharide utilization and a decrease in the use of simple sugars. Here, we apply antibiotic susceptibility testing, transcriptomic analysis, and genetic manipulation to characterize this polysaccharide-mediated tolerance (PM tolerance) phenotype. We found that a variety of mono- and disaccharides increased the susceptibility of  to several different β-lactams compared to polysaccharides. Transcriptomics indicated a metabolic shift from reductive to oxidative branches of the tricarboxylic acid cycle on polysaccharides. Accordingly, supplementation with intermediates of central carbon metabolism had varying effects on PM tolerance. Transcriptional analysis also showed a decrease in the expression of the electron transport chain (ETC) protein NQR and an increase in the ETC protein NUO, when given fiber versus glucose. Deletion of NQR increased  susceptibility while deletion of NUO and a third ETC protein NDH2 had no effect. This work confirms that carbon source utilization modulates antibiotic susceptibility in  and that anaerobic respiratory metabolism and the ETC play an essential role.IMPORTANCEAntibiotics are indispensable medications that revolutionized modern medicine.

Recent work has investigated the role of metabolism in antibiotic susceptibility in distantly related bacteria such as . Using antibiotic susceptibility testing, transcriptomics, and genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that polysaccharides reduce β-lactam susceptibility when compared to monosaccharides. This finding underscores the profound impact of metabolic adaptation on the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics.

    "abstract": "The distinct human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression pattern of human extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) endows them with unique tolerogenic properties that enable successful pregnancy. Nevertheless, how this process is elaborately regulated remains elusive. Previously, E74 like ETS transcription factor 3 (ELF3) was identified to govern high-level HLA-C expression in EVT. In the present study, ELF3 is found to bind to the enhancer region of two adjacent NOD-like receptor (NLR) genes, NLR family pyrin domain-containing 2 and 7 (NLRP2, NLRP7). Notably, our analysis of ELF3-deficient JEG-3 cells, a human choriocarcinoma cell line widely used to study EVT biology, suggests that ELF3 transactivates  while suppressing the expression of NLRP2. Moreover, we find that NLRP2 and NLRP7 have opposing effects on HLA-C expression, thus implicating them in immune evasion at the maternal-fetal interface. We confirmed that NLRP2 suppresses HLA-C levels and described a unique role for NLRP7 in promoting HLA-C expression in JEG-3. These results suggest that these two NLR genes, which arose via gene duplication in primates, are fine-tuned by ELF3 yet have acquired divergent functions to enable proper expression levels of HLA-C in EVT, presumably through modulating the degradation kinetics of IkBα. Targeting the ELF3-NLRP2/NLRP7-HLA-C axis may hold therapeutic potential for managing pregnancy-related disorders, such as recurrent hydatidiform moles and fetal growth restriction, and thus improve placental development and pregnancy outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is caused by loss of expression of paternally expressed genes in the human 15q11.2-q13 imprinting domain. A set of imprinted genes that are active on the paternal but silenced on the maternal chromosome are intricately regulated by a bipartite imprinting center (PWS-IC) located in the PWS imprinting domain. In past work, we discovered that euchromatic histone lysine N-methyltransferase-2 (EHMT2/G9a) inhibitors were capable of un-silencing PWS-associated genes by restoring their expression from the maternal chromosome. Here, in mice lacking the  gene, we document un-silencing of the imprinted  gene on the maternal chromosome in the late embryonic and postnatal brain. Using PWS and Angelman syndrome patient derived cells with either paternal or maternal deletion of 15q11-q13, we have found that chromatin of maternal PWS-IC is closed and has compact 3D folding confirmation. We further show that a new and distinct noncoding RNA preferentially transcribed from upstream of the PWS-IC interacts with EHMT2 and forms a heterochromatin complex to silence gene expression of  in CIS on maternal chromosome. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that allele-specific recruitment of EHMT2 is required to maintain the maternal imprints. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights and support a new model for imprinting maintenance of the PWS imprinted domain.",

We therefore obtained non-human primate (NHP) parathyroids to provide a suitable alternative for sequencing that would bear a close semblance to human organs. Single-cell RNA expression analysis of parathyroids from four healthy adult  reveals a continuous trajectory of epithelial cell states. Pseudotime analysis based on transcriptomic signatures suggests a progression from   progenitors to mature parathyroid hormone ()-expressing epithelial cells with increasing core mitochondrial transcript abundance along pseudotime. We sequenced, as a comparator, four histologically characterized hyperfunctioning human parathyroids with varying oxyphil and chief cell abundance and leveraged advanced computational techniques to highlight similarities and differences from non-human primate parathyroid expression dynamics. Predicted cell-cell communication analysis reveals abundant endothelial cell interactions in the parathyroid cell microenvironment in both human and NHP parathyroid glands. We show abundant  transcripts in both human adenoma and normal primate parathyroid cells and use coimmunostaining to reveal high levels of RARRES2 protein (also known as chemerin) in PTH-expressing cells, which could indicate that RARRES2 plays an unrecognized role in parathyroid endocrine function. The data obtained are the first single-cell RNA transcriptome to characterize nondiseased parathyroid cell signatures and to show a transcriptomic progression of cell states within normal parathyroid glands, which can be used to better understand parathyroid cell biology.",

Despite providing crucial insights, scHi-C data is often underutilized due to the high cost and the complexity of the experimental protocol. We present a deep learning framework, scGrapHiC, that predicts pseudo-bulk scHi-C contact maps using pseudo-bulk scRNA-seq data. Specifically, scGrapHiC performs graph deconvolution to extract genome-wide single-cell interactions from a bulk Hi-C contact map using scRNA-seq as a guiding signal. Our evaluations show that scGrapHiC, trained on seven cell-type co-assay datasets, outperforms typical sequence encoder approaches. For example, scGrapHiC achieves a substantial improvement of 23.2% in recovering cell-type-specific Topologically Associating Domains over the baselines. It also generalizes to unseen embryo and brain tissue samples. scGrapHiC is a novel method to generate cell-type-specific scHi-C contact maps using widely available genomic signals that enables the study of cell-type-specific chromatin interactions.",

    "abstract": "The human polyomavirus, JCPyV, establishes a lifelong persistent infection in the peripheral organs of a majority of the human population worldwide. Patients who are immunocompromised due to underlying infections, cancer, or to immunomodulatory treatments for autoimmune disease are at risk for developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) when the virus invades the CNS and infects macroglial cells in the brain parenchyma. It is not yet known how the virus enters the CNS to cause disease. The blood-choroid plexus barrier is a potential site of virus invasion as the cells that make up this barrier are known to be infected with virus both  and . To understand the effects of virus infection on these cells we challenged primary human choroid plexus epithelial cells with JCPyV and profiled changes in host gene expression. We found that viral infection induced the expression of proinflammatory chemokines and downregulated junctional proteins essential for maintaining blood-CSF and blood-brain barrier function. These data contribute to our understanding of how JCPyV infection of the choroid plexus can modulate the host cell response to neuroinvasive pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in cardiac macrophage biology have broadened our understanding of the critical functions of macrophages in the heart. As a result, there is further interest in understanding the independent contributions of distinct subsets of macrophage to cardiac development and function. Here, we demonstrate that genetic loss of interferon regulatory factor 8 (Irf8)-positive embryonic-derived macrophages significantly disrupts cardiac conduction, chamber function, and innervation in adult zebrafish. At 4 months post-fertilization (mpf), homozygous  mutants have significantly shortened atrial action potential duration and significant differential expression of genes involved in cardiac contraction. Functional  assessments via electro- and echocardiograms at 12 mpf reveal that  mutants are arrhythmogenic and exhibit diastolic dysfunction and ventricular stiffening. To identify the molecular drivers of the functional disturbances in  null zebrafish, we perform single cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry, which reveal increased leukocyte infiltration, epicardial activation, mesenchymal gene expression, and fibrosis.  null hearts are also hyperinnervated and have aberrant axonal patterning, a phenotype not previously assessed in the context of cardiac macrophage loss. Gene ontology analysis supports a novel role for activated epicardial-derived cells (EPDCs) in promoting neurogenesis and neuronal remodeling . Together, these data uncover significant cardiac abnormalities following embryonic macrophage loss and expand our knowledge of critical macrophage functions in heart physiology and governing homeostatic heart health.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary mechanisms that drive the emergence of genome architecture remain poorly understood but can now be assessed with unprecedented power due to the massive accumulation of genome assemblies spanning phylogenetic diversity. Transposable elements (TEs) are a rich source of large-effect mutations since they directly and indirectly drive genomic structural variation and changes in gene expression. Here, we demonstrate universal patterns of TE compartmentalization across eukaryotic genomes spanning ~1.7 billion years of evolution, in which TEs colocalize with gene families under strong predicted selective pressure for dynamic evolution and involved in specific functions. For non-pathogenic species these genes represent families involved in defense, sensory perception and environmental interaction, whereas for pathogenic species, TE-compartmentalized genes are highly enriched for pathogenic functions. Many TE-compartmentalized gene families display signatures of positive selection at the molecular level. Furthermore, TE-compartmentalized genes exhibit an excess of high-frequency alleles for polymorphic TE insertions in fruit fly populations. We postulate that these patterns reflect selection for adaptive TE insertions as well as TE-associated structural variants. This process may drive the emergence of a shared TE-compartmentalized genome architecture across diverse eukaryotic lineages.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have reported a correlation between a SNP of the RING finger E3 ubiquitin protein ligase rififylin (RFFL) and QT interval variability in humans (Newton-Cheh et al., 2009). Previously, we have shown that RFFL downregulates expression and function of the human-like ether-a-go-go-related gene potassium channel and corresponding rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (I) in adult rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes. Here, we report that RFFL also affects the transient outward current (I), but in a peculiar way. RFFL overexpression in adult rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes significantly decreases the contribution of its fast component (I) from 35% to 21% and increases the contribution of its slow component (I) from 65% to 79%. Since I in rabbits is mainly conducted by Kv4.3, we investigated the effect of RFFL on Kv4.3 expressed in HEK293A cells. We found that RFFL overexpression reduced Kv4.3 expression and corresponding I in a RING domain-dependent manner in the presence or absence of its accessory subunit Kv channel-interacting protein 2. On the other hand, RFFL overexpression in Kv1.4-expressing HEK cells leads to an increase in both Kv1.4 expression level and I, similarly in a RING domain-dependent manner. Our physiologically detailed rabbit ventricular myocyte computational model shows that these yin and yang effects of RFFL overexpression on I and I affect phase 1 of the action potential waveform and slightly decrease its duration in addition to suppressing I. Thus, RFFL modifies cardiac repolarization reserve via ubiquitination of multiple proteins that differently affect various potassium channels and cardiac action potential duration.",

Mass cytometry identified early and sustained elevation of the costimulatory molecule CD80 expressed on -deficient mouse macrophages, monocytes, and microglia. Enrichment of CD80 was similarly observed in human spinal cord microglia from patients with -mediated ALS compared with non-ALS controls. Single-cell RNA sequencing of murine spinal cord, brain cortex, and spleen demonstrated coordinated induction of gene modules related to antigen processing and presentation and antiviral immunity in -deficient endothelial cells, microglia, and macrophages. Mechanistically, C9ORF72 repressed the trafficking of CD80 to the cell surface in response to Toll-like receptor agonists, interferon-γ, and IL-17A. Deletion of  in -deficient mice prevented CD80 enrichment in the spinal cord, reduced neutrophilia, and reduced gut T helper type 17 cells. Last, systemic delivery of an IL-17A neutralizing antibody augmented motor performance and suppressed neuroinflammation in -deficient mice. Altogether, we show that  orchestrates myeloid costimulatory potency and provide support for IL-17A as a therapeutic target for neuroinflammation associated with ALS or FTD.",

    "title": "Evolution of gene expression across brain regions in behaviourally divergent deer mice.",
    "abstract": "The evolution of innate behaviours is ultimately due to genetic variation likely acting in the nervous system. Gene regulation may be particularly important because it can evolve in a modular brain-region specific fashion through the concerted action of cis- and trans-regulatory changes. Here, to investigate transcriptional variation and its regulatory basis across the brain, we perform RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on ten brain subregions in two sister species of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus and P. polionotus)-which differ in a range of innate behaviours, including their social system-and their F hybrids. We find that most of the variation in gene expression distinguishes subregions, followed by species. Interspecific differential expression (DE) is pervasive (52-59% of expressed genes), whereas the number of DE genes between sexes is modest overall (~3%). Interestingly, the identity of DE genes varies considerably across brain regions. Much of this modularity is due to cis-regulatory divergence, and while 43% of genes were consistently assigned to the same gene regulatory class across subregions (e.g. conserved, cis- or trans-regulatory divergence), a similar number were assigned to two or more different gene regulatory classes. Together, these results highlight the modularity of gene expression differences and divergence in the brain, which may be key to explain how the evolution of brain gene expression can contribute to the astonishing diversity of animal behaviours.",

Artemisinin exposure results in a dynamic transcriptional response across multiple pathways, but most work has focused on ring stages and  transcriptional analysis. We applied single cell RNAseq to two unsynchronized coisogenic parasite lines (K13 and K13) over 6 hrs after a pulse exposure to dihydroartemisinin (DHA). Transcription was altered across all stages, with the greatest occurring at the trophozoite and ring stage in both lines. This response involved the arrest of metabolic processes, support for a dormancy phenomenon upon treatment, and the enhancement of protein trafficking and the unfolded protein response. While similar, the response was consistent across stages in K13, with enhanced parasite survival to drug induced stress. Increased surface protein expression was seen in K13 parasites at baseline and upon drug exposure, highlighted by the increased expression of  and , a potential therapeutic target. Antibody targeting GARP maintained anti-parasitic efficacy in K13 parasites. This work provides single cell insight of gene transcription across all life cycle stages revealing transcriptional changes that could initiate a dormancy state and mediate survival upon treatment.",

However, ribosomal behavior can deviate at each of these steps, sometimes in a programmed manner. Certain mRNAs contain sequence and structural elements that cause ribosomes to begin translation at alternative start codons, shift reading frame, read through stop codons, or reinitiate on the same mRNA. These processes represent important translational control mechanisms that can allow an mRNA to encode multiple functional protein products or regulate protein expression.

    "abstract": "In mammalian brains, millions to billions of cells form complex interaction networks to enable a wide range of functions. The enormous diversity and intricate organization of cells have impeded our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of brain function. Recent advances in spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics have enabled systematic mapping of the spatial organization of molecularly defined cell types in complex tissues, including several brain regions (for example, refs. ). However, a comprehensive cell atlas of the whole brain is still missing. Here we imaged a panel of more than 1,100 genes in approximately 10 million cells across the entire adult mouse brains using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization and performed spatially resolved, single-cell expression profiling at the whole-transcriptome scale by integrating multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization and single-cell RNA sequencing data. Using this approach, we generated a comprehensive cell atlas of more than 5,000 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters, belonging to more than 300 major cell types, in the whole mouse brain with high molecular and spatial resolution. Registration of this atlas to the mouse brain common coordinate framework allowed systematic quantifications of the cell-type composition and organization in individual brain regions. We further identified spatial modules characterized by distinct cell-type compositions and spatial gradients featuring gradual changes of cells. Finally, this high-resolution spatial map of cells, each with a transcriptome-wide expression profile, allowed us to infer cell-type-specific interactions between hundreds of cell-type pairs and predict molecular (ligand-receptor) basis and functional implications of these cell-cell interactions. These results provide rich insights into the molecular and cellular architecture of the brain and a foundation for functional investigations of neural circuits and their dysfunction in health and disease.",

ALKBH8 is a tRNA modifying enzyme that methylates wobble uridines in specific tRNAs to modulate translation. Through methylation of tRNA-selenocysteine, ALKBH8 promotes selenoprotein synthesis and regulates redox homeostasis. Pathogenic variants in ALKBH8 have been linked to intellectual disability disorders in the human population, but the role of ALKBH8 in the nervous system is unknown. Through  studies in , we show that ALKBH8 controls oxidative stress in the brain to restrain synaptic growth and support learning and memory.  null animals lack wobble uridine methylation and exhibit a global reduction in protein synthesis, including a specific decrease in selenoprotein levels. Loss of  or independent disruption of selenoprotein synthesis results in ectopic synapse formation. Genetic expression of antioxidant enzymes fully suppresses synaptic overgrowth in  null animals, confirming oxidative stress as the underlying cause of dysregulation.  animals also exhibit associative learning and memory impairments that are reversed by pharmacological antioxidant treatment. Together, these findings demonstrate the critical role of tRNA modification in redox homeostasis in the nervous system and reveal antioxidants as a potential therapy for ALKBH8-associated intellectual disability.",

    "abstract": "Differences in chromatin state inherited from the parental gametes influence the regulation of maternal and paternal alleles in offspring. This phenomenon, known as genomic imprinting, results in genes preferentially transcribed from one parental allele. While local epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation are known to be important for the establishment of imprinted gene expression, less is known about the mechanisms by which differentially methylated regions (DMRs) lead to differences in allelic expression across broad stretches of chromatin. Allele-specific higher-order chromatin structure has been observed at multiple imprinted loci, consistent with the observation of allelic binding of the chromatin-organizing factor CTCF at multiple DMRs. However, whether allelic chromatin structure impacts allelic gene expression is not known for most imprinted loci. Here we characterize the mechanisms underlying brain-specific imprinted expression of the  locus, an imprinted region associated with intellectual disability. We performed region capture Hi-C on mouse brains from reciprocal hybrid crosses and found imprinted higher-order chromatin structure caused by the allelic binding of CTCF to the  DMR. Using an in vitro neuron differentiation system, we showed that imprinted chromatin structure precedes imprinted expression at the locus. Additionally, activation of a distal enhancer induced imprinted expression of  in an allelic chromatin structure-dependent manner. This work provides a high-resolution map of imprinted chromatin structure and demonstrates that chromatin state established in early development can promote imprinted expression upon differentiation.",

To gain an initial insight into how tumor-related genes may be expressed and function during marine invertebrate development, we here leverage sea urchin embryos as a model system and characterize the expressions of Myc and p53/p63/p73 which are reported to function synergistically in mammalian models as an oncogene and tumor suppressor, respectively.",

    "title": "Irisin deficiency exacerbates diet-induced insulin resistance and cardiac dysfunction in type II diabetes in mice.",
    "abstract": "Irisin is involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological conditions, metabolism, and survival. We and others have demonstrated that irisin contributes critically to modulation of insulin resistance and the improvement of cardiac function. However, whether the deletion of irisin will regulate cardiac function and insulin sensitivity in type II diabetes remains unclear. We utilized the CRISPR/Cas-9 genome-editing system to delete irisin globally in mice and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced type II diabetes model. We found that irisin deficiency did not result in developmental abnormality during the adult stage, which illustrates normal cardiac function and insulin sensitivity assessed by glucose tolerance test in the absence of stress. The ultrastructural analysis of the transmission electronic microscope (TEM) indicated that deletion of irisin did not change the morphology of mitochondria in myocardium. Gene expression profiling showed that several key signaling pathways related to integrin signaling, extracellular matrix, and insulin-like growth factors signaling were coordinately downregulated by deletion of irisin. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet and chow food for 16 wk, ablation of irisin in mice exposed to HFD resulted in much more severe insulin resistance, metabolic derangements, profound cardiac dysfunction, and hypertrophic response and remodeling as compared with wild-type control mice. Taken together, our results indicate that the loss of irisin exacerbates insulin resistance, metabolic disorders, and cardiac dysfunction in response to HFD and promotes myocardial remodeling and hypertrophic response. This evidence reveals the molecular evidence and the critical role of irisin in modulating insulin resistance and cardiac function in type II diabetes. By utilizing the CRISPR/Cas-9 genome-editing system and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced type II diabetes model, our results provide direct evidence showing that the loss of irisin exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and insulin resistance while promoting myocardial remodeling and a hypertrophic response in HFD-induced diabetes. This study provides new insight into understanding the molecular evidence and the critical role of irisin in modulating insulin resistance and cardiac function in type II diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Investigation of translation in rare cell types or subcellular contexts is challenging due to large input requirements for standard approaches. Here, we present \"nanoRibo-seq\" an optimized approach using 10- to 10-fold less input material than bulk approaches. nanoRibo-seq exhibits rigorous quality control features consistent with quantification of ribosome protected fragments with as few as 1,000 cells. We compare translatomes of two closely related cortical neuron subtypes, callosal projection neurons (CPN) and subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN), during their early postnatal development. We find that, while translational efficiency is highly correlated between CPN and SCPN, several dozen mRNAs are differentially translated. We further examine upstream open reading frame (uORF) translation and identify that mRNAs involved in synapse organization and axon development are highly enriched for uORF translation in both subtypes. nanoRibo-seq enables investigation of translational regulation of rare cell types in vivo and offers a flexible approach for globally quantifying translation from limited input material.",

Using ReDACT, we created a panel of isogenic cells that have or lack common aneuploidies, and we demonstrate that trisomy of chromosome 1q is required for malignant growth in cancers harboring this alteration. Mechanistically, gaining chromosome 1q increases the expression of  and suppresses p53 signaling, and we show that  mutations are mutually exclusive with 1q aneuploidy in human cancers. Thus, tumor cells can be dependent on specific aneuploidies, raising the possibility that these \"aneuploidy addictions\" could be targeted as a therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Differences in chromatin state inherited from the parental gametes influence the regulation of maternal and paternal alleles in offspring. This phenomenon, known as genomic imprinting, results in genes preferentially transcribed from one parental allele. While local epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation are known to be important for the establishment of imprinted gene expression, less is known about the mechanisms by which differentially methylated regions (DMRs) lead to differences in allelic expression across broad stretches of chromatin. Allele-specific higher-order chromatin structure has been observed at multiple imprinted loci, consistent with the observation of allelic binding of the chromatin-organizing factor CTCF at multiple DMRs. However, whether allelic chromatin structure impacts allelic gene expression is not known for most imprinted loci. Here we characterize the mechanisms underlying brain-specific imprinted expression of the  locus, an imprinted region associated with intellectual disability. We performed region capture Hi-C on mouse brain from reciprocal hybrid crosses and found imprinted higher-order chromatin structure caused by the allelic binding of CTCF to the  DMR. Using an  neuron differentiation system, we show that on the maternal allele enhancer-promoter contacts formed early in development prime the brain-specific potassium leak channel  for maternal expression prior to neurogenesis. In contrast, these enhancer-promoter contacts are blocked by CTCF on the paternal allele, preventing paternal  activation. This work provides a high-resolution map of imprinted chromatin structure and demonstrates that chromatin state established in early development can promote imprinted expression upon differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Over 400,000 people are estimated to have been exposed to World Trade Center particulate matter (WTC) since the attack on the Twin Towers in Lower Manhattan on September 11, 2001. Epidemiological studies have found that exposure to dust may cause respiratory ailments and cardiovascular diseases. However, limited studies have performed a systematic analysis of transcriptomic data to elucidate the biological responses to WTC exposure and the therapeutic options. Here, we developed an in vivo mouse exposure model of WTC and administered two drugs (i.e., rosoxacin and dexamethasone) to generate transcriptomic data from lung samples. WTC exposure increased the inflammation index, and this index was significantly reduced by both drugs. We analyzed the transcriptomics derived omics data using a hierarchical systems biology model (HiSBiM) with four levels, including system, subsystem, pathway, and gene analyses. Based on the selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from each group, WTC and the two drugs commonly affected the inflammatory responses, consistent with the inflammation index. Among these DEGs, the expression of 31 genes was affected by WTC exposure and consistently reversed by the two drugs, and these genes included Psme2, Cldn18, and Prkcd, which are involved in immune- and endocrine-related subsystems and pathways such as thyroid hormone synthesis, antigen processing and presentation, and leukocyte transendothelial migration. Furthermore, the two drugs reduced the inflammatory effects of WTC through distinct pathways, e.g., vascular-associated signaling by rosoxacin, whereas mTOR-dependent inflammatory signaling was found to be regulated by dexamethasone. To the best of our knowledge, this study constitutes the first investigation of transcriptomics data of WTC and an exploration of potential therapies. We believe that these findings provide strategies for the development of promising optional interventions and therapies for airborne particle exposure.",

Despite the major impact of cachexia on the treatment, quality of life, and survival of cancer patients, relatively little is known about the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Hyperglycemia detected in glucose tolerance test is one of the earliest metabolic abnormalities observed in cancer patients; however, the pathogenesis by which tumors influence blood sugar levels remains poorly understood. Here, utilizing a  model, we demonstrate that the tumor secreted interleukin-like cytokine Upd3 induces fat body expression of  and , two key regulatory enzymes of gluconeogenesis, contributing to hyperglycemia. Our data further indicate a conserved regulation of these genes by IL-6/JAK-STAT signaling in mouse models. Importantly, in both fly and mouse cancer cachexia models, elevated gluconeogenesis gene levels are associated with poor prognosis. Altogether, our study uncovers a conserved role of Upd3/IL-6/JAK-STAT signaling in inducing tumor-associated hyperglycemia, which provides insights into the pathogenesis of IL-6 signaling in cancer cachexia.",

Gap junctions and electrical synapses in the central nervous system are associated with fast transmission and synchronous patterns of firing within neuronal networks.

One such gene, the novel insect-specific gene  was first identified based on its role in establishing the  germ line. We previously showed that this gene likely arose through an unusual domain transfer event involving bacterial endosymbionts and played a somatic role before evolving its well-known germ line function. Here, we provide empirical support for this hypothesis in the form of evidence for a neural role for . We show that  is expressed in the adult neural stem cells of a hemimetabolous insect, the cricket .

We provide evidence that  positively regulates , which plays a conserved role in long-term memory across animals, and that  in turn may be a direct target of Creb. Together with previous reports of a role for  in nervous system development and function in crickets and flies, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that 's original somatic role may have been in the insect nervous system. Moreover, its colocalization and functional cooperation with the conserved pluripotency gene  in the nervous system may have facilitated 's later co-option to the germ line in holometabolous insects.",

    "abstract": "Humans coexisted and interbred with other hominins which later became extinct. These archaic hominins are known to us only through fossil records and for two cases, genome sequences. Here, we engineer Neanderthal and Denisovan sequences into thousands of artificial genes to reconstruct the pre-mRNA processing patterns of these extinct populations. Of the 5,169 alleles tested in this massively parallel splicing reporter assay (MaPSy), we report 962 exonic splicing mutations that correspond to differences in exon recognition between extant and extinct hominins. Using MaPSy splicing variants, predicted splicing variants, and splicing quantitative trait loci, we show that splice-disrupting variants experienced greater purifying selection in anatomically modern humans than that in Neanderthals. Adaptively introgressed variants were enriched for moderate-effect splicing variants, consistent with positive selection for alternative spliced alleles following introgression. As particularly compelling examples, we characterized a unique tissue-specific alternative splicing variant at the adaptively introgressed innate immunity gene , as well as a unique Neanderthal introgressed alternative splicing variant in the gene  that encodes perlecan. We further identified potentially pathogenic splicing variants found only in Neanderthals and Denisovans in genes related to sperm maturation and immunity. Finally, we found splicing variants that may contribute to variation among modern humans in total bilirubin, balding, hemoglobin levels, and lung capacity. Our findings provide unique insights into natural selection acting on splicing in human evolution and demonstrate how functional assays can be used to identify candidate causal variants underlying differences in gene regulation and phenotype.",

However, it is not known why some individuals develop disease, whereas others do not. We found that smoke-exposed AKR mice were more susceptible to lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) than C57BL/6 mice (Sakhatskyy P, Wang Z, Borgas D, Lomas-Neira J, Chen Y, Ayala A, Rounds S, Lu Q.  312: L56-L67, 2017); thus, we investigated strain-dependent lung transcriptomic responses to cigarette smoke (CS). Eight-week-old male AKR and C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 3 wk of room air (RA) or cigarette smoke (CS) for 6 h/day, 4 days/wk, followed by intratracheal instillation of LPS or normal saline (NS) and microarray analysis of lung homogenate gene expression. Other groups of AKR and C57 mice were exposed to RA or CS for 6 wk, followed by evaluation of static lung compliance and tissue elastance, morphometric evaluation for emphysema, or microarray analysis of lung gene expression. Transcriptomic analyses of lung homogenates show distinct strain-dependent lung transcriptional responses to CS and LPS, with AKR mice having larger numbers of genes affected than similarly treated C57 mice, congruent with strain differences in physiologic and inflammatory parameters previously observed in LPS-induced ALI after CS priming. These results suggest that genetic differences may underlie differing susceptibility of smokers to ARDS and emphysema. Strain-based differences in gene transcription contribute to CS and LPS-induced lung injury. There may be a genetic basis for smoking-related lung injury. Clinicians should consider cigarette smoke exposure as a risk factor for ALI and ARDS. We demonstrate that transcriptomes expressed in lung homogenates also differ between the mouse strains and after acute (3 wk) exposure of animals to cigarette smoke (CS) and/or to lipopolysaccharide. Mouse strains also differed in physiologic, pathologic, and transcriptomic, responses to more prolonged (6 wk) exposure to CS. These data support a genetic basis for enhanced susceptibility to acute and chronic lung injury among humans who smoke cigarettes.",

Differences in the primordial germ cells (PGCs) of two sea urchin species were examined here by stage-matched, integrated, single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets. Even though both species rely on inherited mechanisms to specify their germ line, this analysis revealed a variety of differences in germline gene expression, including a broader expression of the germline factor  () in  () compared to  (). In ,  mRNA expression is highly restricted to the PGCs by a lability element in its 3'UTR, which is lacking in the mRNA of -, thus explaining the difference. We discovered that the - 3'UTR instead leads to its specific translation in the PGCs.

    "abstract": "The identification of genomic loci that are associated with osteoarthritis (OA) has provided a starting point for understanding how genetic variation activates catabolic processes in the joint. However, genetic variants can only alter gene expression and cellular function when the epigenetic environment is permissive to these effects. In this review, we provide examples of how epigenetic shifts at distinct life stages can alter the risk for OA, which we posit is critical for the proper interpretation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). During development, intensive work on the growth and differentiation factor 5 () locus has revealed the importance of tissue-specific enhancer activity in controlling both joint development and the subsequent risk for OA. During homeostasis in adults, underlying genetic risk factors may help establish beneficial or catabolic \"set points\" that dictate tissue function, with a strong cumulative effect on OA risk. During aging, methylation changes and the reorganization of chromatin can \"unmask\" the effects of genetic variants. The destructive function of variants that alter aging would only mediate effects after reproductive competence and thus avoid any evolutionary selection pressure, as consistent with larger frameworks of biological aging and its relationship to disease. A similar \"unmasking\" may occur during OA progression, which is supported by the finding of distinct expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in chondrocytes depending on the degree of tissue degradation. Finally, we propose that massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) will be a valuable tool to test the function of putative OA GWAS variants in chondrocytes from different life stages.",

    "abstract": "The controlled release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) into productive elongation is a major step in gene regulation. However, functional analysis of Pol II pausing is difficult because factors that regulate pause release are almost all essential. In this study, we identified heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in  , which encodes SPT5, in individuals with β-thalassemia unlinked to  mutations. During erythropoiesis in healthy human cells, cell cycle genes were highly paused at the transition from progenitors to precursors. When the pathogenic mutations were recapitulated by  editing, Pol II pause release was globally disrupted, and the transition from progenitors to precursors was delayed, marked by a transient lag in erythroid-specific gene expression and cell cycle kinetics. Despite this delay, cells terminally differentiate, and cell cycle phase distributions normalize. Therefore, hindering pause release perturbs proliferation and differentiation dynamics at a key transition during erythropoiesis, revealing a role for Pol II pausing in the temporal coordination between the cell cycle and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian brains, tens of millions to billions of cells form complex interaction networks to enable a wide range of functions. The enormous diversity and intricate organization of cells in the brain have so far hindered our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of its functions. Recent advances in spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics have allowed systematic mapping of the spatial organization of molecularly defined cell types in complex tissues. However, these approaches have only been applied to a few brain regions and a comprehensive cell atlas of the whole brain is still missing. Here, we imaged a panel of >1,100 genes in ~8 million cells across the entire adult mouse brain using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) and performed spatially resolved, single-cell expression profiling at the whole-transcriptome scale by integrating MERFISH and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Using this approach, we generated a comprehensive cell atlas of >5,000 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters, belonging to ~300 major cell types, in the whole mouse brain with high molecular and spatial resolution. Registration of the MERFISH images to the common coordinate framework (CCF) of the mouse brain further allowed systematic quantifications of the cell composition and organization in individual brain regions defined in the CCF. We further identified spatial modules characterized by distinct cell-type compositions and spatial gradients featuring gradual changes in the gene-expression profiles of cells. Finally, this high-resolution spatial map of cells, with a transcriptome-wide expression profile associated with each cell, allowed us to infer cell-type-specific interactions between several hundred pairs of molecularly defined cell types and predict potential molecular (ligand-receptor) basis and functional implications of these cell-cell interactions. These results provide rich insights into the molecular and cellular architecture of the brain and a valuable resource for future functional investigations of neural circuits and their dysfunction in diseases.",

However, current methods capture only one layer of omics information at a time, precluding the possibility of examining the mechanistic relationship across the central dogma of molecular biology. Here, we present two technologies for spatially resolved, genome-wide, joint profiling of the epigenome and transcriptome by cosequencing chromatin accessibility and gene expression, or histone modifications (H3K27me3, H3K27ac or H3K4me3) and gene expression on the same tissue section at near-single-cell resolution. These were applied to embryonic and juvenile mouse brain, as well as adult human brain, to map how epigenetic mechanisms control transcriptional phenotype and cell dynamics in tissue. Although highly concordant tissue features were identified by either spatial epigenome or spatial transcriptome we also observed distinct patterns, suggesting their differential roles in defining cell states. Linking epigenome to transcriptome pixel by pixel allows the uncovering of new insights in spatial epigenetic priming, differentiation and gene regulation within the tissue architecture.

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy is a frequent occurrence in fungal species where it can alter gene expression and promote adaptation to a variety of environmental cues. Multiple forms of aneuploidy have been observed in the opportunistic fungal pathogen  which is a common component of the human gut mycobiome but can escape this niche and cause life-threatening systemic disease. Using a barcode sequencing (Bar-seq) approach, we evaluated a set of diploid  strains and found that a strain carrying a third copy of chromosome (Chr) 7 was associated with increased fitness during both gastrointestinal (GI) colonization and systemic infection. Our analysis revealed that the presence of a Chr 7 trisomy resulted in decreased filamentation, both in vitro and during GI colonization, relative to isogenic euploid controls. A target gene approach demonstrated that , encoding a negative regulator of filamentation located on Chr 7, contributes to increased fitness of the aneuploid strain due to inhibition of filamentation in a gene dosage-dependent fashion. Together, these experiments establish how aneuploidy enables the reversible adaptation of  to its host via gene dosage-dependent regulation of morphology.",

PANGEA allows GO analysis to be performed on different sets of GO annotations, for example excluding high-throughput studies. Beyond GO, gene sets for pathway annotation and protein complex data from various resources as well as expression and disease annotation from the Alliance of Genome Resources (Alliance). In addition, visualisations of results are enhanced by providing an option to view network of gene set to gene relationships.

    "abstract": "Corticospinal neurons (CSN) are centrally required for skilled voluntary movement, which necessitates that they establish precise subcerebral connectivity with the brainstem and spinal cord. However, molecular controls regulating specificity of this projection targeting remain largely unknown. We previously identified that developing CSN subpopulations exhibit striking axon targeting specificity in the spinal white matter. These CSN subpopulations with segmentally distinct spinal projections are also molecularly distinct; a subset of differentially expressed genes between these distinct CSN subpopulations regulate differential axon projection targeting. Rostrolateral CSN extend axons exclusively to bulbar-cervical segments (CSN), while caudomedial CSN (CSN) are more heterogeneous, with distinct, intermingled subpopulations extending axons to either bulbar-cervical or thoraco-lumbar segments. Here, we report, in male and female mice, that  () is expressed specifically by CSN in medial, but not lateral, sensorimotor cortex.  shows highly dynamic temporal expression, with  levels in CSN highest during the period of peak axon extension toward thoraco-lumbar segments. Using gain-of-function experiments, we identify that Cbln1 is sufficient to direct thoraco-lumbar axon extension by CSN. Misexpression of Cbln1 in CSN either by  electroporation, or by postmitotic AAV-mediated gene delivery, redirects these axons past their normal bulbar-cervical targets toward thoracic segments. Further, Cbln1 overexpression in postmitotic CSN increases the number of CSN axons that extend past cervical segments into the thoracic cord. Collectively, these results identify that Cbln1 functions as a potent molecular control over thoraco-lumbar CSN axon extension, part of an integrated network of controls over segmentally-specific CSN axon projection targeting. Corticospinal neurons (CSN) exhibit remarkable diversity and precision of axonal projections to targets in the brainstem and distinct spinal segments; the molecular basis for this targeting diversity is largely unknown. CSN subpopulations projecting to distinct targets are also molecularly distinguishable. Distinct subpopulations degenerate in specific motor neuron diseases, further suggesting that intrinsic molecular differences might underlie differential vulnerability to disease. Here, we identify a novel molecular control, Cbln1, expressed by CSN extending axons to thoraco-lumbar spinal segments. Cbln1 is sufficient, but not required, for CSN axon extension toward distal spinal segments, and  expression is controlled by recently identified, CSN-intrinsic regulators of axon extension. Our results identify that Cbln1, together with other regulators, coordinates segmentally precise CSN axon targeting.",

    "abstract": "Advanced urothelial carcinoma continues to have a dismal prognosis despite several new therapies in the last 5 years.  and  mutations and fusions, PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability are established predictive biomarkers in advanced urothelial carcinoma. Novel biomarkers can optimize the sequencing of available treatments and improve outcomes. We describe herein the clinical and pathologic features of patients with an emerging subtype of bladder cancer characterized by deletion of the gene  encoding the enzyme S-Methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphatase, a potential biomarker of response to pemetrexed. We performed a retrospective analysis of 61 patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma for whom demographics, pathologic specimens, next generation sequencing, and clinical outcomes were available. We compared the frequency of histology variants, upper tract location, pathogenic gene variants, tumor response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients with tumors harboring  deletion (-del) and wild type tumors (-WT). A propensity score matching of 5 covariates (age, gender, presence of variant histology, prior surgery, and prior non-muscle invasive bladder cancer) was calculated to compensate for disparity when comparing survival in these subgroups. Non-supervised clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes between -del and -WT urothelial carcinomas was performed. -del occurred in 19 patients (31%). Tumors with -del were characterized by higher prevalence of squamous differentiation (47.4 vs 11.9%), bone metastases (52.6 vs 23.5%) and lower frequency of upper urinary tract location (5.2% vs 26.1%). Pathway gene set enrichment analysis showed that among the genes upregulated in the -del cohort, at least 5 were linked to keratinization (FOXN1, KRT33A/B, KRT84, RPTN) possibly contributing to the higher prevalence of squamous differentiation. Alterations in the PIK3 and MAPK pathways were more frequent when  was deleted. There was a trend to inferior response to chemotherapy among -del tumors, but no difference in the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors or enfortumab. Median progression free survival after first line therapy (PFS1) was 5.5 months for patients with -WT and 4.5 months for patients with -del (HR = 1.30; 95% CI, 0.64-2.63; P = 0.471). There was no difference in the time from metastatic diagnosis to death (P = 0.6346). Median OS from diagnosis of localized or de novo metastatic disease was 16 months (range 1.5-60, IQR 8-26) for patients with MTAP-del and 24.5 months (range 3-156, IQR 16-48) for patients with MTAP-WT (P = 0.0218), suggesting that time to progression to metastatic disease is shorter in MTAP-del patients. Covariates did not impact significantly overall survival on propensity score matching. In conclusion, MTAP -del occurs in approximately 30% of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma and defines a subgroup of patients with aggressive features, such as squamous differentiation, frequent bone metastases, poor response to chemotherapy, and shorter time to progression to metastatic disease.",

Recent technological advancements have made it possible to systematically probe gene function for redundant genes using dual or multiplex gene perturbation, and there is a need for a simple bioinformatic tool to identify putative paralogs of a gene(s) of interest. We have developed Paralog Explorer (https://www.flyrnai.org/tools/paralogs/), an online resource that allows researchers to quickly and accurately identify candidate paralogous genes in the genomes of the model organisms  and . Paralog Explorer deploys an effective between-species ortholog prediction software, DIOPT, to analyze within-species paralogs. Paralog Explorer allows users to identify candidate paralogs, and to navigate relevant databases regarding gene co-expression, protein-protein and genetic interaction, as well as gene ontology and phenotype annotations. Altogether, this tool extends the value of current ortholog prediction resources by providing sophisticated features useful for identification and study of paralogous genes.",

HO-1 can also enter the nucleus and regulate gene transcription independent of its enzymatic activity. Whether HO-1 can alter gene expression through direct binding to target DNA remains unclear. Here, we performed HO-1 CHIP-seq and then employed 3D structural modeling to reveal putative HO-1 DNA binding domains. We identified three probable DNA binding domains on HO-1. Using the Proteinarium, we identified several genes as the most highly connected nodes in the interactome among the HO-1 gene binding targets. We further demonstrated that HO-1 modulates the expression of these key genes using  deficient cells. Finally, mutation of four conserved amino acids (E215, I211, E201, and Q27) within HO-1 DNA binding domain 1 significantly increased expression of Gtpbp3 and Eif1 genes that were identified within the top 10 binding hits normalized by gene length predicted to bind this domain. Based on these data, we conclude that HO-1 protein is a putative DNA binding protein, and regulates targeted gene expression. This provides the foundation for developing specific inhibitors or activators targeting HO-1 DNA binding domains to modulate targeted gene expression and corresponding cellular function.",

Here, we employed our recently developed integrated methodology to characterize the physicochemical and biological properties of emitted PM as a function of three common hardwoods (oak, cherry, mesquite) and three representative combustion conditions (flaming, smoldering, incomplete). Differences in PM and off-gas emissions (aerosol number/mass concentrations; carbon monoxide; volatile organic compounds) as well as inorganic elemental composition and organic carbon functional content of PM were noted between wood types and combustion conditions, although the combustion scenario exerted a stronger influence on the emission profile. More importantly, flaming combustion PM from all hardwoods significantly stimulated the promoter activity of Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) pointed domain containing ETS (E-twenty-six) Transcription Factor (SPDEF) in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293 T) cells, a biomarker for mucin gene expression associated with mucus production in pulmonary diseases. However, no bioactivity was observed for smoldering and incomplete combustion, which was likely driven by differences in the organic composition of PM. Detailed chemical speciation of organic components of wood smoke is warranted to identify the individual compounds that drive specific biological responses.",

Here, we present an integrated methodology that allows to generate, sample, and characterize wood smoke derived from different moisture contents and representative combustion conditions using pine wood as a model. Flaming, smoldering, and incomplete combustion were assessed for low-moisture pine, whereas both low-moisture pine and high-moisture pine were investigated under flaming conditions. Real-time monitoring of carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and aerosol number concentration/size in wood smoke was performed. The PM was size-fractionated, sampled, and characterized for elemental/organic carbon, organic functional groups, and inorganic elements. Bioactivity of PM was assessed by measuring the sterile alpha motif (SAM) pointed domain containing ETS (E-twenty-six) transcription factor (SPDEF) gene promoter activity in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293T) cells, a biomarker for mucin gene expression. Findings showed that moisture content and combustion condition significantly affected the organic and inorganic elemental composition of PM as well as its bioactivity. Also, for a given moisture and combustion scenario, PM chemistry and bioactivity differed considerably with PM size. Importantly, PM from flaming combustion of low-moisture pine contained the highest abundance of the oxygenated saturated aliphatic functional group [H-C-O] and was also biologically most potent in stimulating SPDEF promoter activity, suggesting the role of organic compounds such as carbohydrates and sugar alcohols (that contain [H-C-O]) in driving mucus-related respiratory outcomes. Our platform enables further well-controlled parametric studies using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to link wood burning parameters with acute and chronic inhalation health effects of wood smoke.",

    "abstract": " has become an important drug-resistant nosocomial pathogen because of widespread antibiotic abuse. We developed short and chemically simple antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with a selective amino acid composition, fixed charge, and hydrophobicity ratio based on the core antimicrobial motif of bovine lactoferrin (LfcinB6). Among these peptides, 5L and 6L (both 12 residues long) demonstrated a narrow spectrum and high antibacterial activity against drug-resistant  isolates with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) that ranged from 4-16 µg/mL. At 32 µg/mL, peptides 5L and 6L inhibited  strain C68 biofilm formation by 90% and disrupted established biofilms by 75%. At 40 µg/mL, 5L reduced 1 × 10 persister cells by 3 logs within 120 min of exposure, whereas 6L eliminated all persister cells within 60 min. At 0.5× MIC, 5L and 6L significantly downregulated the expression of a crucial biofilm gene  by 8 folds ( = 0.02) and 4 folds ( = 0.01), respectively. At 32 µg/mL, peptides 5L and 6L both depolarized the  membrane, increased fluidity, and eventually ruptured the membrane. Physiologically, 5L (at 8 µg/mL) altered the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glutathione, and purine metabolism. Interestingly, in an ex vivo model of porcine skin infection, compared to no treatment, 5L (at 10× MIC) effectively eliminated all 1 × 10 exponential ( = 0.0045) and persister  cells ( = 0.0002). In conclusion, the study outlines a roadmap for developing narrow-spectrum selective AMPs and presents peptide 5L as a potential therapeutic candidate to be explored against .",

The emergence of spatial transcriptomics has enabled genome-scale gene expression mapping, but the ability to capture spatial epigenetic information of tissue at the cellular level and genome scale is lacking. Here we describe a method for spatially resolved chromatin accessibility profiling of tissue sections using next-generation sequencing (spatial-ATAC-seq) by combining in situ Tn5 transposition chemistry and microfluidic deterministic barcoding. Profiling mouse embryos using spatial-ATAC-seq delineated tissue-region-specific epigenetic landscapes and identified gene regulators involved in the development of the central nervous system. Mapping the accessible genome in the mouse and human brain revealed the intricate arealization of brain regions. Applying spatial-ATAC-seq to tonsil tissue resolved the spatially distinct organization of immune cell types and states in lymphoid follicles and extrafollicular zones. This technology progresses spatial biology by enabling spatially resolved chromatin accessibility profiling to improve our understanding of cell identity, cell state and cell fate decision in relation to epigenetic underpinnings in development and disease.",

We use morphological, molecular, and experimental approaches to examine the Plethodontidae, a dominant family of salamanders, all of which are lungless as adults. We confirm an early anecdotal report that plethodontids complete early stages of lung morphogenesis: Transient embryonic lung primordia form but regress by apoptosis before hatching. Initiation of pulmonary development coincides with expression of the lung-specification gene  in adjacent mesoderm, and the lung rudiment expresses pulmonary markers  and . Lung developmental-genetic pathways are at least partially conserved despite the absence of functional adult lungs for at least 25 and possibly exceeding 60 million years. Adult lung loss appears associated with altered expression of signaling molecules that mediate later stages of tracheal and pulmonary development.",

Whether Cpt1a upregulation attenuates hyperoxia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction and lung injury remains unknown.

    "abstract": "Microglia are specialized macrophages in the brain parenchyma that exist in multiple transcriptional states and reside within a wide range of neuronal environments. However, how and where these states are generated remains poorly understood. Here, using the mouse somatosensory cortex, we demonstrate that microglia density and molecular state acquisition are determined by the local composition of pyramidal neuron classes. Using single-cell and spatial transcriptomic profiling, we unveil the molecular signatures and spatial distributions of diverse microglia populations and show that certain states are enriched in specific cortical layers, whereas others are broadly distributed throughout the cortex. Notably, conversion of deep-layer pyramidal neurons to an alternate class identity reconfigures the distribution of local, layer-enriched homeostatic microglia to match the new neuronal niche. Leveraging the transcriptional diversity of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex, we construct a ligand-receptor atlas describing interactions between individual pyramidal neuron subtypes and microglia states, revealing rules of neuron-microglia communication. Our findings uncover a fundamental role for neuronal diversity in instructing the acquisition of microglia states as a potential mechanism for fine-tuning neuroimmune interactions within the cortical local circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Animal tissues comprise diverse cell types. However, the mechanisms controlling the number of each cell type within tissue compartments remain poorly understood. Here, we report that different cell types utilize distinct strategies to control population numbers. Proliferation of fibroblasts, stromal cells important for tissue integrity, is limited by space availability. In contrast, proliferation of macrophages, innate immune cells involved in defense, repair, and homeostasis, is constrained by growth factor availability. Examination of density-dependent gene expression in fibroblasts revealed that Hippo and TGF-β target genes are both regulated by cell density. We found YAP1, the transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo signaling pathway, directly regulates expression of , the lineage-specific growth factor for macrophages, through an enhancer of  that is specifically active in fibroblasts. Activation of YAP1 in fibroblasts elevates  expression and is sufficient to increase the number of macrophages at steady state. Our data also suggest that expression programs in fibroblasts that change with density may result from sensing of mechanical force through actin-dependent mechanisms. Altogether, we demonstrate that two different modes of population control are connected and coordinated to regulate cell numbers of distinct cell types. Sensing of the tissue environment may serve as a general strategy to control tissue composition.",

    "abstract": "Studies identifying bacterial members that dictate host phenotype have focused mainly on the dominant members, and the role of low abundance microbes in determining host phenotypes and pathogenesis of diseases remains unexplored. In this study, we compared the gut bacterial community of mice with wide-ranging microbial exposure to determine if low abundance bacteria vary based on microbial exposure or remain consistent. We noted that similar to the high abundance bacterial community, a core community of low abundance bacteria made up a significant portion of the gut microbiome irrespective of microbial exposure. To determine the role of low abundance bacteria in regulating community composition and host gene expression, we devised a microbiome dilution strategy to \"delete\" out low abundance bacteria and engrafted the diluted microbiomes into germ-free mice. Our approach successfully excluded low abundance bacteria from small and large intestinal bacterial communities and induced global changes in microbial community composition in the large intestine. Gene expression analysis of intestinal tissue revealed that loss of low abundance bacteria resulted in a drastic reduction in expression of multiple genes involved MHCII antigen presentation pathway and T-cell cytokine production in the small intestine. The effect of low abundance bacteria on MHCII expression was found to be specific to the intestinal epithelium at an early timepoint post-colonization and correlated with bacteria belonging to the family . We conclude that low abundance bacteria have a significantly higher immuno-stimulatory effect compared to dominant bacteria and are thus potent drivers of early immune education in the gut.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has shown great potential in gene therapy due to its low immunogenicity, lack of pathogenicity to humans, and ability to provide long-term gene expression . However, there is currently a need for fast, high-throughput characterization systems that require low volumes for the determination of its sample composition in terms of full and empty capsids since empty capsids are a natural byproduct of AAV synthesis. To address this need, the following study proposes a high-throughput electrophoresis-mediated microfluidics approach that is independent of sample input concentration to estimate the composition of a given sample by combining its protein and ssDNA information relative to a standard. Using this novel approach, we were able to estimate the percentage of full capsids of six AAV8 samples with an average deviation from the actual percentage of 4%. The experiments used for these estimations were conducted with samples of varying percentages of full capsids (21-75%) and varying concentrations (5 × 10-1 × 10 VP/mL) with a total volume requirement of 3-10 μL for triplicate analysis of the sample. This method offers a rapid way to evaluate the quality and purity of AAV products. We believe that our method addresses the critical need as recognized by the gene and molecular therapy community.",

Here, we focus on the oldfield mouse (), which occurs in the southeastern United States, where it exhibits considerable color variation. Dorsal coats range from dark brown in mainland mice to near white in mice inhabiting sandy beaches; this light pelage has evolved independently on Florida's Gulf and Atlantic coasts as camouflage from predators. To facilitate genomic analyses, we first generated a chromosome-level genome assembly of . Next, in a uniquely variable mainland population (), we scored 23 pigment traits and performed targeted resequencing in 168 mice. We find that pigment variation is strongly associated with an ∼2-kb region ∼5 kb upstream of the  coding region. Using a reporter-gene assay, we demonstrate that this regulatory region contains an enhancer that drives expression in the dermis of mouse embryos during the establishment of pigment prepatterns. Moreover, extended tracts of homozygosity in this  region indicate that the light allele experienced recent and strong positive selection. Notably, this same light allele appears fixed in both Gulf and Atlantic coast beach mice, despite these populations being separated by >1,000 km. Together, our results suggest that this identified  enhancer allele has been maintained in mainland populations as standing genetic variation and from there, has spread to and been selected in two independent beach mouse lineages, thereby facilitating their rapid and parallel evolution.",

    "abstract": "Decoding the complexity of the brain requires an understanding of the architecture, function, and development of its neuronal circuits. Neuronal classifications that group neurons based on specific features/behaviors have become essential to further analyze the different subtypes in a systematic and reproducible way. A comprehensive taxonomic framework, accounting for multiple defining and quantitative features, will provide the reference to infer generalized rules for cells ascribed to the same neuronal type, and eventually predict cellular behaviors, even in the absence of experimental measures. Technologies that enable cell-type classification in the nervous system are rapidly evolving in scalability and resolution. While these approaches depict astonishing diversity in neuronal morphology, electrophysiology, and gene expression, a robust metric of the coherence between different profiling modalities leading to a unified classification is still largely missing. Focusing on GABAergic neurons of the cerebral cortex, Gouwens . pioneered the first integrated cell-type classification based on the simultaneous analysis of the transcriptional networks, the recording of intrinsic electrophysiological properties, and the reconstruction of 3D morphologies of the same cell. Their comprehensive and high-quality data provide a new framework to shed light on what may be considered a \"neuronal cell type.\"",

    "abstract": "During infection, animals exhibit adaptive changes in physiology and behaviour aimed at increasing survival. Although many causes of infection exist, they trigger similar stereotyped symptoms such as fever, warmth-seeking, loss of appetite and fatigue. Yet exactly how the nervous system alters body temperature and triggers sickness behaviours to coordinate responses to infection remains unknown. Here we identify a previously uncharacterized population of neurons in the ventral medial preoptic area (VMPO) of the hypothalamus that are activated after sickness induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid. These neurons are crucial for generating a fever response and other sickness symptoms such as warmth-seeking and loss of appetite. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization uncovered the identity and distribution of LPS-activated VMPO (VMPO) neurons and non-neuronal cells. Gene expression and electrophysiological measurements implicate a paracrine mechanism in which the release of immune signals by non-neuronal cells during infection activates nearby VMPO neurons. Finally, we show that VMPO neurons exert a broad influence on the activity of brain areas associated with behavioural and homeostatic functions and are synaptically and functionally connected to circuit nodes controlling body temperature and appetite. Together, these results uncover VMPO neurons as a control hub that integrates immune signals to orchestrate multiple sickness symptoms in response to infection.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a systemic immune response to infection that is responsible for ~35% of in-hospital deaths and over 24 billion dollars in annual treatment costs. Strategic targeting of non-redundant negative immune checkpoint protein pathways can cater therapeutics to the individual septic patient and improve prognosis. B7-CD28 superfamily member V-domain Immunoglobulin Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA) is an ideal candidate for strategic targeting in sepsis. We hypothesized that immune checkpoint regulator, VISTA, controls T-regulatory cells (T), in response to septic challenge, thus playing a protective role/reducing septic morbidity/mortality. Further, we investigated if changes in morbidity/mortality are due to a T-mediated effect during the acute response to septic challenge. To test this, we used the cecal ligation and puncture model as a proxy for polymicrobial sepsis and assessed the phenotype of CD4 T in VISTA-gene deficient (VISTA) and wild-type mice. We also measured changes in survival, soluble indices of tissue injury, and circulating cytokines in the VISTA and wild-type mice. We found that in wild-type mice, CD4 T exhibit a significant upregulation of VISTA which correlates with higher T abundance in the spleen and small intestine following septic insult. However, VISTA mice have reduced T abundance in these compartments met with a higher expression of Foxp3, CTLA4, and CD25 compared to wild-type mice. VISTA mice also have a significant survival deficit, higher levels of soluble indicators of liver injury (i.e., ALT, AST, bilirubin), and increased circulating proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IL-17F, IL-23, and MCP-1) following septic challenge. To elucidate the role of T in VISTA sepsis mortality, we adoptively transferred VISTA-expressing T into VISTA mice. This adoptive transfer rescued VISTA survival to wild-type levels. Taken together, we propose a protective T-mediated role for VISTA by which inflammation-induced tissue injury is suppressed and improves survival in early-stage murine sepsis. Thus, enhancing VISTA expression or adoptively transferring VISTA T in early-stage sepsis may provide a novel therapeutic approach to ameliorate inflammation-induced death.",

Here we describe a simple strategy to achieve physiologically relevant oxygen tension in a two-channel human small intestine-on-a-chip (Intestine Chip) lined with primary human duodenal epithelium and intestinal microvascular endothelium in parallel channels separated by a porous membrane while both channels are perfused with oxygenated medium. This strategy was developed using computer simulations that predicted lowering the oxygen permeability of poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chips in specified locations using a gas impermeable film will allow the cells to naturally decrease the oxygen concentration through aerobic respiration and reach steady-state oxygen levels <36 mm Hg (<5%) within the epithelial lumen. The approach was experimentally confirmed using chips with embedded oxygen sensors that maintained this stable oxygen gradient. Furthermore, Intestine Chips cultured with this approach supported formation of a villus epithelium interfaced with a continuous endothelium and maintained intestinal barrier integrity for 72 h. This strategy recapitulates  functionality in an efficient, inexpensive, and scalable format that improves the robustness and translatability of Organ Chip technology for studies on microbiome as well as oxygen sensitivity.",

Divergence in many morphological traits, and some behaviors, is linked to cis-regulatory changes in gene expression. Given this, we compare brain gene expression of two interfertile sister species of Peromyscus mice that show large and heritable differences in burrowing behavior. Species-level differential expression and allele-specific expression in F hybrids indicate a preponderance of cis-regulatory divergence, including many genes whose cis-regulation is affected by burrowing behavior. Genes related to locomotor coordination show the strongest signals of lineage-specific selection on burrowing-induced cis-regulatory changes. Furthermore, genetic markers closest to these candidate genes associate with variation in burrow shape in a genetic cross, suggesting an enrichment for loci affecting burrowing behavior near these candidate locomotor genes. Our results provide insight into how cis-regulated gene expression can depend on behavioral context and how this dynamic regulatory divergence between species may contribute to behavioral evolution.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cells interact with solid surfaces and change their lifestyle from single free-swimming cells to sessile communal structures (biofilms). Cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is central to this process, yet we lack tools for direct dynamic visualization of c-di-GMP in single cells. Here, we developed a fluorescent protein-based c-di-GMP-sensing system for  that allowed us to visualize initial signaling events and assess the role played by the flagellar motor. The sensor was pH sensitive, and the events that appeared on a seconds' timescale were alkaline spikes in the intracellular pH. These spikes were not apparent when signals from different cells were averaged. Instead, a signal appeared on a minutes' timescale that proved to be due to an increase in intracellular c-di-GMP. This increase, but not the alkaline spikes, depended upon a functional flagellar motor. The kinetics and the amplitude of both the pH and c-di-GMP responses displayed cell-to-cell variability indicative of the distinct ways the cells approached and interacted with the surface. The energetic status of a cell can modulate these events. In particular, the alkaline spikes displayed an oscillatory behavior and the c-di-GMP increase was modest in the presence of glucose.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) leads to considerable morbidity, yet strategies for therapeutic angiogenesis fall short of being impactful. Inflammatory macrophage subsets play an important role in orchestrating post-developmental angiogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we find that macrophage VEGF-A expression is dependent upon the potent inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. IL-1β promotes pro-angiogenic VEGF-Aa isoform transcription via activation and promoter binding of STAT3 and NF-κB, as demonstrated by gene-deletion, gain-of-function, inhibition, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Conversely, IL-1β-deletion or inhibition of STAT3 or NF-κB increases anti-angiogenic VEGF-Ab isoform expression, indicating IL-1β signaling may also direct splice variant selection. In an experimental PAD model of acute limb ischemia, macrophage IL-1β expression is required for pro-angiogenic VEGF-A expression and for VEGF-A-induced blood flow recovery via angio- or arteriogenesis. Though further study is needed, macrophage IL-1β-dependent transcription of VEGF-A via STAT3 and NF-κB may have potential to therapeutically promote angiogenesis in the setting of PAD.",

Overexpressing Sirt6 extends lifespan in mice, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are unclear.  are an excellent model to study genetic regulation of lifespan; however, despite extensive study in mammals, very little is known about Sirt6 function in flies. Here, we characterized the  ortholog of Sirt6, dSirt6, and examined its role in regulating longevity; dSirt6 is a nuclear and chromatin-associated protein with NAD-dependent histone deacetylase activity.  overexpression (OE) in flies produces robust lifespan extension in both sexes, while reducing  levels shortens lifespan.  OE flies have normal food consumption and fertility but increased resistance to oxidative stress and reduced protein synthesis rates. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that  OE reduces expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, including many dMyc target genes.  OE partially rescues many effects of  OE, including increased nuclear size, up-regulation of ribosome biogenesis genes, and lifespan shortening. Last,  haploinsufficiency does not convey additional lifespan extension to  OE flies, suggesting  OE is upstream of  in regulating lifespan. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms by which Sirt6 OE leads to longer lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been practiced in the treatment of bone diseases and alcoholism. Chronic excessive alcohol use results in alcohol-induced bone diseases, including osteopenia and osteoporosis, which increases fracture risk, deficient bone repair, and osteonecrosis. This preclinical study investigated the therapeutic effects of TCM herbal extracts in animal models of chronic excessive alcohol consumption-induced osteopenia. TCM herbal extracts (Jing extracts) were prepared from nine Chinese herbal medicines, a combinative herbal formula for antifatigue and immune regulation, including , , , , , , , , and . In this study, Balb/c male mice were orally administrated alcohol (3.2 g/kg/day) with/without TCM herbal extracts (0.125 g/kg, 0.25 g/kg, or 0.5 g/kg) by gavage. Our results showed that after 50 days of oral administration, TCM herbal extracts prevented alcohol-induced osteopenia demonstrated by μ-CT bone morphological analysis in young adults and middle-aged/old Balb/c male mice. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that chronic alcohol consumption inhibits bone formation and has a neutral impact on bone resorption, suggesting that TCM herbal extracts (Jing extracts) mitigate the alcohol-induced abnormal bone metabolism in middle-aged/old male mice. Protocatechuic acid, a natural phenolic acid in Jing extracts, mitigates  alcohol-induced decline of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) gene expression in the bone marrow of Balb/c male mice and  ALP activity in pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells. Our study suggests that TCM herbal extracts prevent chronic excessive alcohol consumption-induced osteopenia in male mice, implying that traditional medicinal plants have the therapeutic potential of preventing alcohol-induced bone diseases.",

    "abstract": "The RNA-binding protein FUS (Fused in Sarcoma) mediates phase separation in biomolecular condensates and functions in transcription by clustering with RNA polymerase II. Specific contact residues and interaction modes formed by FUS and the C-terminal heptad repeats of RNA polymerase II (CTD) have been suggested but not probed directly. Here we show how RGG domains contribute to phase separation with the FUS N-terminal low-complexity domain (SYGQ LC) and RNA polymerase II CTD. Using NMR spectroscopy and molecular simulations, we demonstrate that many residue types, not solely arginine-tyrosine pairs, form condensed-phase contacts via several interaction modes including, but not only sp-π and cation-π interactions. In phases also containing RNA polymerase II CTD, many residue types form contacts, including both cation-π and hydrogen-bonding interactions formed by the conserved human CTD lysines. Hence, our data suggest a surprisingly broad array of residue types and modes explain co-phase separation of FUS and RNA polymerase II.",

    "abstract": "Liver transplantation is hampered by a severe shortage of donor organs. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of donor livers allows dynamic preservation in addition to viability assessment before transplantation. Little is known about the injury and repair mechanisms induced during NMP. To investigate these mechanisms, we examined gene and protein expression changes in a cohort of discarded human livers, stratified by hepatocellular function, during NMP. Six human livers acquired through donation after circulatory death (DCD) underwent 12 h of NMP. Of the six livers, three met predefined criteria for adequate hepatocellular function. We applied transcriptomic profiling and protein analysis to evaluate temporal changes in gene expression during NMP between functional and nonfunctional livers. Principal component analysis segregated the two groups and distinguished the various perfusion time points. Transcriptomic analysis of biopsies from functional livers indicated robust activation of innate immunity after 3 h of NMP followed by enrichment of prorepair and prosurvival mechanisms. Nonfunctional livers demonstrated delayed and persistent enrichment of markers of innate immunity. Functional livers demonstrated effective induction of autophagy, a cellular repair and homeostasis pathway, in contrast to nonfunctional livers. In conclusion, NMP of discarded DCD human livers results in innate immune-mediated injury, while also activating autophagy, a presumed mechanism for support of cellular repair. More pronounced activation of autophagy was seen in livers that demonstrated adequate hepatocellular function. We demonstrate that ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs in all livers during NMP, though there are notable differences in gene expression between functional and nonfunctional livers. We further demonstrate that activation of the liver's repair and homeostasis mechanisms through autophagy plays a vital role in the graft's response to injury and may impact liver function. These findings indicate that liver autophagy might be a key therapeutic target for rehabilitating the function of severely injured or untransplantable livers.",

    "abstract": "Cells can use self recognition to achieve cooperative behaviors. Self-recognition genes are thought to principally evolve in tandem with partner self-recognition alleles. However, other constraints on protein evolution could exist. Here, we have identified an interaction outside self-recognition loci that could constrain the sequence variation of a self-recognition protein. We show that during collective swarm expansion in Proteus mirabilis, self-recognition signaling co-opts SdaC, a serine transporter. Serine uptake is crucial for bacterial survival and colonization. Single-residue variants of SdaC reveal that self recognition requires an open conformation of the protein; serine transport is dispensable. A distant ortholog from Escherichia coli is sufficient for self recognition; however, a paralogous serine transporter, YhaO, is not. Thus, SdaC couples self recognition and serine transport, likely through a shared molecular interface. Self-recognition proteins may follow the framework of a complex interaction network rather than an isolated two-protein system. Understanding the molecular and ecological constraints on self-recognition proteins lays the groundwork for insights into the evolution of self recognition and emergent collective behaviors.  Bacteria can receive secret messages from kin during migration. For Proteus mirabilis, these messages are necessary for virulence in multispecies infections. We show that a serine transporter, conserved among gammaproteobacteria, enables self-recognition. Molecular co-option of nutrient uptake could limit the sequence variation of these message proteins. SdaC is the primary transporter for l-serine, a vital metabolite for colonization during disease. Unlike many self-recognition receptors, SdaC is sufficiently conserved between species to achieve recognition. The predicted open conformation is shared by transport and recognition. SdaC reveals the interdependence of communication and nutrient acquisition. As the broader interactions of self-recognition proteins are studied, features shared among microbial self-recognition systems, such as those of  spp. and  spp., could emerge.",

Manifesting a reciprocal cellular distribution pattern, the SHH receptors  and  and transcription factors  and  are expressed by chondrocytes (OAC) in OA cartilage.

    "abstract": "A mammalian brain is composed of numerous cell types organized in an intricate manner to form functional neural circuits. Single-cell RNA sequencing allows systematic identification of cell types based on their gene expression profiles and has revealed many distinct cell populations in the brain. Single-cell epigenomic profiling further provides information on gene-regulatory signatures of different cell types. Understanding how different cell types contribute to brain function, however, requires knowledge of their spatial organization and connectivity, which is not preserved in sequencing-based methods that involve cell dissociation. Here we used a single-cell transcriptome-imaging method, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), to generate a molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse primary motor cortex. We profiled approximately 300,000 cells in the mouse primary motor cortex and its adjacent areas, identified 95 neuronal and non-neuronal cell clusters, and revealed a complex spatial map in which not only excitatory but also most inhibitory neuronal clusters adopted laminar organizations. Intratelencephalic neurons formed a largely continuous gradient along the cortical depth axis, in which the gene expression of individual cells correlated with their cortical depths. Furthermore, we integrated MERFISH with retrograde labelling to probe projection targets of neurons of the mouse primary motor cortex and found that their cortical projections formed a complex network in which individual neuronal clusters project to multiple target regions and individual target regions receive inputs from multiple neuronal clusters.",

Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) computational tool cBioPortal, we evaluated overall patient survival in BRCA1 mRNA-low versus -high cohorts (<-1.29 versus >1.05 SD from mean BRCA1 expression, respectively). Analysis included 1082 BC patients with mRNA data (PanCancer Atlas), 382 CRCs (Firehose Legacy) and 592 CRCs (PanCancer Atlas). As previously reported, BRCA1 mRNA-low tumor expression positively correlated with BC patient survival but was negatively associated in CRC. We observed a correlation between BRCA1 mRNA-high and age <45 years at CRC diagnosis using a Fisher's exact test [Firehose Legacy database (-value = 0.0091); CRC PanCancer Atlas (-value = 0.0778)]. We correlated BRCA1 mRNA-low expression and basal BC (-value = 0.0016) and BRCA1 mRNA-low tumors and frequency of African American patients (-value = 0.0448) with BC. Other trends included higher frequency of advanced lymph node stage and mucinous adenocarcinoma among BRCA1 mRNA-low CRC and higher frequency of males in BRCA1 mRNA-high BC and CRC. African Americans more frequently had BRCA1 mRNA-low BC and BRCA1 mRNA-high CRC and the opposite was observed among Asians. Using a gene co-expression tool (cBioPortal), we observed TOP2A and ATAD5 levels correlate (Spearman's correlation>0.6) with BRCA1 in BC and CRC, whereas LMNB2 correlates with BRCA1 in CRC, suggesting tissue-specific BRCA1 interactions. Our results indicate potential for BRCA1 mRNA expression levels as a prognostic biomarker in BC and CRC, suggest tissue-specificity in BRCA1 molecular interactions, and point to BRCA1 mRNA-high levels as a characteristic of CRC tumors in younger versus older individuals.",

We previously observed a stabilization of HIF-1α by cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1 and CDK4/6 that is independent of VHL, hypoxia or p53, and found that CDK4/6 inhibitors destabilize HIF-1α under normoxia and hypoxia. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of HIF-1α destabilization by CDK1 or CDK4/6 inhibitors, we performed a proteomic screen on immunoprecipitated HIF-1α from hypoxic colorectal cancer cells that were either untreated or treated with CDK1 inhibitor Ro3306 and CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. Our proteomics screen identified a number of candidates that were enriched in palbociclib-treated hypoxic cells including SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (Smurf2). We also identified a HIF-1α peptide that appeared to be differentially phosphorylated after palbociclib treatment. Gene knockdown of  increased basal expression of HIF-1α even in the presence of Ro3306 or two different CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib and abemaciclib. Overexpression of Smurf2 inhibited expression of HIF-1α and enhanced HIF-1α ubiquitination in normoxia. Proteasome inhibitor MG-132 partially rescued HIF-1α expression when Smurf2 was overexpressed. Smurf2 overexpression also inhibited HIF-1α expression level in two other cell lines, SW480 and VHL-deficient RCC4. Overexpression of  mRNA is correlated with improved disease-free survival and overall survival in clear cell renal cell cancer. Our results unravel a previously unknown mechanism involving Smurf2 for HIF-1α destabilization in CDK4/6 inhibitor-treated cells, thereby shedding light on VHL-independent HIF-1α regulation.",

Previous studies have shown that the diversity of spur length across the Aquilegia genus is a key innovation that is tightly linked with its recent and rapid diversification into new ranges, and that evolution of increased spur lengths is achieved via anisotropic cell elongation. Previous work identified a brassinosteroid response transcription factor as being enriched in the early developing spur cup. Brassinosteroids are known to be important for cell elongation, suggesting that brassinosteroid-mediated response may be an important regulator of spur elongation and potentially a driver of spur length diversity in Aquilegia. In this study, we investigated the role of brassinosteroids in the development of the Aquilegia coerulea petal spur.",

However, there is a lack of effective means to accelerate the regeneration of neurons of particular subtypes for pathogenesis and clinical therapy. In this study, we find that hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanorods promote neural differentiation of neural stem cells due to their chemical compositions. Lysosome-mediated degradation of HAp nanorods elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and accelerates GABAergic neurogenesis. As a mechanism, the enhanced activity of a Ca peak initiated by HAp nanorods leads to the activation of c-Jun and thus suppresses the expression of GABAergic/glutamatergic selection gene TLX3. We demonstrate the capability of HAp nanorods in promoting the differentiation into GABAergic neurons at both molecular and cellular function levels. Given that GABAergic neurons are responsible for various physiological and pathological processes, our findings open up enormous opportunities in efficient and precise stem cell therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Ventilatory support, such as supplemental oxygen, used to save premature infants impairs the growth of the pulmonary microvasculature and distal alveoli, leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although lung cellular composition changes with exposure to hyperoxia in neonatal mice, most human BPD survivors are weaned off oxygen within the first weeks to months of life, yet they may have persistent lung injury and pulmonary dysfunction as adults. We hypothesized that early-life hyperoxia alters the cellular landscape in later life and predicts long-term lung injury. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we mapped lung cell subpopulations at postnatal day (pnd)7 and pnd60 in mice exposed to hyperoxia (95% O) for 3 days as neonates. We interrogated over 10,000 cells and identified a total of 45 clusters within 32 cell states. Neonatal hyperoxia caused persistent compositional changes in later life (pnd60) in all five type II cell states with unique signatures and function. Premature infants requiring mechanical ventilation with different durations also showed similar alterations in these unique signatures of type II cell states. Pathologically, neonatal hyperoxic exposure caused alveolar simplification in adult mice. We conclude that neonatal hyperoxia alters the lung cellular landscape in later life, uncovering neonatal programing of adult lung dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Inaccurate expression of the genetic code, also known as mistranslation, is an emerging paradigm in microbial studies. Growing evidence suggests that many microbial pathogens can deliberately mistranslate their genetic code to help invade a host or evade host immune responses. However, discovering different capacities for deliberate mistranslation remains a challenge because each group of pathogens typically employs a unique mistranslation mechanism. In this study, we address this problem by studying duplicated genes of aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases. Using bacterial prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) genes as an example, we identify an anomalous ProRS isoform, ProRSx, and a corresponding tRNA, tRNA, that are predominately found in plant pathogens from  species. We then show that tRNA has an unusual hybrid structure that allows this tRNA to mistranslate alanine codons as proline. Finally, we provide biochemical, genetic, and mass spectrometric evidence that cells which express ProRSx and tRNA can translate GCU alanine codons as both alanine and proline. This dual use of alanine codons creates a hidden proteome diversity due to stochastic Ala→Pro mutations in protein sequences. Thus, we show that important plant pathogens are equipped with a tool to alter the identity of their sense codons. This finding reveals the initial example of a natural tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair for dedicated mistranslation of sense codons.",

    "abstract": "Trimethylamine (TMA) is an important gut microbial metabolite strongly associated with human disease. There are prominent gaps in our understanding of how TMA is produced from the essential dietary nutrient l-carnitine, particularly in the anoxic environment of the human gut where oxygen-dependent l-carnitine-metabolizing enzymes are likely inactive. Here, we elucidate the chemical and genetic basis for anaerobic TMA generation from the l-carnitine-derived metabolite γ-butyrobetaine (γbb) by the human gut bacterium  We identify a set of genes up-regulated by γbb and demonstrate that the enzymes encoded by the induced γbb utilization () gene cluster convert γbb to TMA. The key TMA-generating step is catalyzed by a previously unknown type of TMA-lyase enzyme that utilizes a putative flavin cofactor to catalyze a redox-neutral transformation. We identify additional cultured and uncultured host-associated bacteria that possess the  gene cluster, providing insights into the distribution of anaerobic γbb metabolism. Lastly, we present genetic, transcriptional, and metabolomic evidence that confirms the relevance of this metabolic pathway in the human gut microbiota. These analyses indicate that the anaerobic pathway is a more substantial contributor to TMA generation from l-carnitine in the human gut than the previously proposed aerobic pathway. The discovery and characterization of the  pathway provides the critical missing link in anaerobic metabolism of l-carnitine to TMA, enabling investigation into the connection between this microbial function and human disease.",

However, many individuals present with isolated upper respiratory symptoms, suggesting potential to constrain viral pathology to the nasopharynx. Which cells SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets and how infection influences the respiratory epithelium remains incompletely understood. We performed scRNA-seq on nasopharyngeal swabs from 58 healthy and COVID-19 participants. During COVID-19, we observe expansion of secretory, loss of ciliated, and epithelial cell repopulation via deuterosomal cell expansion. In mild and moderate COVID-19, epithelial cells express anti-viral/interferon-responsive genes, while cells in severe COVID-19 have muted anti-viral responses despite equivalent viral loads. SARS-CoV-2 RNA host-target cells are highly heterogenous, including developing ciliated, interferon-responsive ciliated, AZGP1 goblet, and KRT13 \"hillock\"-like cells, and we identify genes associated with susceptibility, resistance, or infection response. Our study defines protective and detrimental responses to SARS-CoV-2, the direct viral targets of infection, and suggests that failed nasal epithelial anti-viral immunity may underlie and precede severe COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian cerebral cortex has an unparalleled diversity of cell types, which are generated during development through a series of temporally orchestrated events that are under tight evolutionary constraint and are critical for proper cortical assembly and function. However, the molecular logic that governs the establishment and organization of cortical cell types remains unknown, largely due to the large number of cell classes that undergo dynamic cell-state transitions over extended developmental timelines. Here we generate a comprehensive atlas of the developing mouse neocortex, using single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing. We sampled the neocortex every day throughout embryonic corticogenesis and at early postnatal ages, and complemented the sequencing data with a spatial transcriptomics time course. We computationally reconstruct developmental trajectories across the diversity of cortical cell classes, and infer their spatial organization and the gene regulatory programs that accompany their lineage bifurcation decisions and differentiation trajectories. Finally, we demonstrate how this developmental map pinpoints the origin of lineage-specific developmental abnormalities that are linked to aberrant corticogenesis in mutant mice. The data provide a global picture of the regulatory mechanisms that govern cellular diversification in the neocortex.",

Type 1 interferon (IFN-I) modulates T cell immunity in viral infection, autoimmunity, and cancer, and may facilitate induction of T cell exhaustion in chronic viral infection. Here we show that IFN-I regulates co-inhibitory receptor expression on human T cells, inducing PD-1/TIM-3/LAG-3 while surprisingly inhibiting TIGIT expression. High-temporal-resolution mRNA profiling of IFN-I responses enabled the construction of dynamic transcriptional regulatory networks uncovering three temporal transcriptional waves. Perturbation of key transcription factors on human primary T cells revealed unique regulators that control expression of co-inhibitory receptors. We found that the dynamic IFN-I response  closely mirrored T cell features with IFN-I linked acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in human, with high  and decreased  expression. Finally, our gene regulatory network identified  as a key regulator for differential  and  expression, which were validated at the level of protein expression. The construction of IFN-I regulatory networks with identification of unique transcription factors controlling co-inhibitory receptor expression may provide targets for enhancement of immunotherapy in cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptional repressor Rev-erbα is known to down-regulate fatty acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis gene expression. In animal models, disruption of Rev-erbα results in global changes in exercise performance, oxidative capacity, and blood glucose levels. However, the complete extent to which Rev-erbα-mediated transcriptional repression of metabolism impacts cell function remains unknown. We hypothesized that loss of Rev-erbα in a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) model would result in global changes in metabolism. MEFs lacking Rev-erbα exhibited a hypermetabolic phenotype, demonstrating increased levels of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Rev-erbα deletion increased expression of hexokinase II, transketolase, and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase genes involved in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and these effects were not mediated by the transcriptional activator BMAL1. Upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation was not accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis or numbers. Rev-erbα repressed proliferation via glycolysis, but not the PPP. When treated with HO, cell viability was reduced in Rev-erbα knockout MEFs, accompanied by increased ratio of oxidized/reduced NADPH, suggesting that perturbation of the PPP reduces capacity to mount an antioxidant defense. These findings uncover novel mechanisms by which glycolysis and the PPP are modulated through Rev-erbα, and provide new insights into how Rev-erbα impacts proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Remdesivir is an antiviral drug initially designed against the  virus. The results obtained with it both in biochemical studies  and in cell line assays  were very promising, but it proved to be ineffective in clinical trials. Remdesivir exhibited far better efficacy when repurposed against SARS-CoV-2. The chemistry that accounts for this difference is the subject of this study. Here, we examine the hypothesis that remdesivir monophosphate (RMP)-containing RNA functions as a template at the polymerase site for the second run of RNA synthesis, and as mRNA at the decoding center for protein synthesis. Our hypothesis is supported by the observation that RMP can be incorporated into RNA by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) of both viruses, although some of the incorporated RMPs are subsequently removed by exoribonucleases. Furthermore, our hypothesis is consistent with the fact that RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 selects RMP for incorporation over AMP by 3-fold , and that RMP-added RNA can be rapidly extended, even though primer extension is often paused when the added RMP is translocated at the  + 3 position (with  the nascent base pair at an initial insertion site of RMP) or when the concentrations of the subsequent nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) are below their physiological concentrations. These observations have led to the hypothesis that remdesivir might be a delayed chain terminator. However, that hypothesis is challenged under physiological concentrations of NTPs by the observation that approximately three-quarters of RNA products efficiently overrun the pause.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive and accurate comparisons of transcriptomic distributions of cells from samples taken from two different biological states, such as healthy versus diseased individuals, are an emerging challenge in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Current methods for detecting differentially abundant (DA) subpopulations between samples rely heavily on initial clustering of all cells in both samples. Often, this clustering step is inadequate since the DA subpopulations may not align with a clear cluster structure, and important differences between the two biological states can be missed. Here, we introduce DA-seq, a targeted approach for identifying DA subpopulations not restricted to clusters. DA-seq is a multiscale method that quantifies a local DA measure for each cell, which is computed from its  nearest neighboring cells across a range of  values. Based on this measure, DA-seq delineates contiguous significant DA subpopulations in the transcriptomic space. We apply DA-seq to several scRNA-seq datasets and highlight its improved ability to detect differences between distinct phenotypes in severe versus mildly ill COVID-19 patients, melanomas subjected to immune checkpoint therapy comparing responders to nonresponders, embryonic development at two time points, and young versus aging brain tissue. DA-seq enabled us to detect differences between these phenotypes. Importantly, we find that DA-seq not only recovers the DA cell types as discovered in the original studies but also reveals additional DA subpopulations that were not described before. Analysis of these subpopulations yields biological insights that would otherwise be undetected using conventional computational approaches.",

This rescue depends on the functional link of DHODH to mitochondrial respiration. The transcription elongation factor TIF1γ directly controls coenzyme Q (CoQ) synthesis gene expression. Upon  loss, CoQ levels are reduced, and a high succinate/α-ketoglutarate ratio leads to increased histone methylation. A CoQ analog rescues 's bloodless phenotype. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial metabolism is a key output of a lineage transcription factor that drives cell fate decisions in the early blood lineage.",

We investigated host-microbiome codiversification in response to xenobiotic-induced selection using an experimental evolution approach. To this end, we exposed the parasitoid wasp  to sublethal concentrations of the widely used herbicide atrazine for 85 generations. Our results reveal that atrazine exposure not only mediated adaptive changes within the microbiome, which conferred host resistance to atrazine toxicity, but also exerted selective pressure on the host genome and altered host gene expression and immune response. Furthermore, microbiome transplant experiments reveal a decreased survival of adults from the control population after exposure to the evolved microbiome of the atrazine-exposed population, while no such decrease occurred in the reciprocal transplant. These results indicate that xenobiotic-induced selection mediated host-microbiome coadaptation, ultimately leading to a new host genome-microbiome equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of genome sizes across the tree of life is of key interest in evolutionary biology. Various correlates of variation in genome size, such as accumulation of transposable elements (TEs) or rate of DNA gain and loss, are well known, but the underlying molecular mechanisms driving or constraining genome size are poorly understood. Here, we study one of the smallest genomes among frogs characterized thus far, that of the ornate burrowing frog () from Australia, and compare it to other published frog and vertebrate genomes to examine the forces driving reduction in genome size. At ∼1.06 gigabases (Gb), the  genome is like that of birds, revealing four major mechanisms underlying TE dynamics: reduced abundance of all major classes of TEs; increased net deletion bias in TEs; drastic reduction in intron lengths; and expansion via gene duplication of the repertoire of TE-suppressing Piwi genes, accompanied by increased expression of Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-based TE-silencing pathway genes in germline cells. Transcriptomes from multiple tissues in both sexes corroborate these results and provide insight into sex-differentiation pathways in  Genome skimming of two closely related frog species ( and ) confirms a reduction in TEs as a major driver of genome reduction in  and supports a macroevolutionary scenario of small genome size in frogs driven by convergence in life history, especially rapid tadpole development and tadpole diet. The  genome offers a model for future comparative studies on mechanisms of genome size reduction in amphibians and vertebrates generally.",

    "abstract": "Morbidity and mortality associated with neonatal sepsis remains a healthcare crisis. PD1 neonatal mice endured experimental sepsis, in the form of cecal slurry (CS), and showed improved rates of survival compared to wildtype (WT) counterparts. End-organ injury, particularly of the lung, contributes to the devastation set forth by neonatal sepsis. PDL1 neonatal mice, in contrast to PD1 neonatal mice did not have a significant improvement in survival after CS. Because of this, we focused subsequent studies on the impact of PD1 gene deficiency on lung injury. Here, we observed that at 24 h post-CS (but not at 4 or 12 h) there was a marked increase in pulmonary edema (PE), neutrophil influx, myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, and cytokine expression sham (Sh) WT mice. Regarding pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) adhesion molecule expression, we observed that Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) within the cell shifted from a membranous location to a peri-nuclear location after CS in WT murine cultured ECs at 24hrs, but remained membranous among PD1 lungs. To expand the scope of this inquiry, we investigated human neonatal lung tissue. We observed that the lungs of human newborns exposed to intrauterine infection had significantly higher numbers of PD1 cells compared to specimens who died from non-infectious causes. Together, these data suggest that PD1/PDL1, a pathway typically thought to govern adaptive immune processes in adult animals, can modulate the largely innate neonatal pulmonary immune response to experimental septic insult. The potential future significance of this area of study includes that PD1/PDL1 checkpoint proteins may be viable therapeutic targets in the septic neonate.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global pandemic. In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19-associated coagulopathies are unknown. Identifying the molecular basis of how SARS-CoV-2 drives coagulation is essential to mitigating short- and long-term thrombotic risks of sick and recovered patients with COVID-19. We aimed to perform coagulation-focused transcriptome analysis of  infected primary respiratory epithelial cells, patient-derived bronchial alveolar lavage cells, and circulating immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective was to identify transcription-mediated signaling networks driving coagulopathies associated with COVID-19. We analyzed recently published experimentally and clinically derived bulk or single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infection to identify changes in transcriptional regulation of blood coagulation. We also confirmed that the transcriptional expression of a key coagulation regulator was recapitulated at the protein level. We specifically focused our analysis on lung tissue-expressed genes regulating the extrinsic coagulation cascade and the plasminogen activation system. Analyzing transcriptomic data of  infected normal human bronchial epithelial cells and patient-derived bronchial alveolar lavage samples revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and suppresses the plasminogen activation system. We also performed  SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments on primary human lung epithelial cells to confirm that transcriptional upregulation of tissue factor, the extrinsic coagulation cascade master regulator, manifested at the protein level. Furthermore, infection of normal human bronchial epithelial cells with influenza A virus did not drive key regulators of blood coagulation in a similar manner as SARS-CoV-2. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not differentially express genes regulating the extrinsic coagulation cascade or plasminogen activation system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that they are not directly inducing coagulopathy through these pathways. The hyperactivation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and the suppression of the plasminogen activation system in SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelial cells may drive diverse coagulopathies in the lung and distal organ systems. Understanding how hosts drive such transcriptional changes with SARS-CoV-2 infection may enable the design of host-directed therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 and other coronaviruses inducing hypercoagulation.",

    "abstract": "A long-term goal in the cancer-field has been to develop strategies for treating p53-mutated tumors. A novel small-molecule, PG3-Oc, restores p53 pathway-signaling in tumor cells with mutant-p53, independently of p53/p73. PG3-Oc partially upregulates the p53-transcriptome (13.7% of public p53 target-gene dataset; 15.2% of in-house dataset) and p53-proteome (18%, HT29; 16%, HCT116-p53). Bioinformatic analysis indicates critical p53-effectors of growth-arrest (p21), apoptosis (PUMA, DR5, Noxa), autophagy (DRAM1), and metastasis-suppression (NDRG1) are induced by PG3-Oc. ERK1/2- and CDK9-kinases are required to upregulate ATF4 by PG3-Oc which restores p53 transcriptomic-targets in cells without functional-p53. PG3-Oc represses MYC (ATF4-independent), and upregulates PUMA (ATF4-dependent) in mediating cell death. With largely nonoverlapping transcriptomes, induced-ATF4 restores p53 transcriptomic targets in drug-treated cells including functionally important mediators such as PUMA and DR5. Our results demonstrate novel p53-independent drug-induced molecular reprogramming involving ERK1/2, CDK9, and ATF4 to restore upregulation of p53 effector genes required for cell death and tumor suppression.",

    "abstract": "Color vision has evolved multiple times in both vertebrates and invertebrates and is largely determined by the number and variation in spectral sensitivities of distinct opsin subclasses. However, because of the difficulty of expressing long-wavelength (LW) invertebrate opsins in vitro, our understanding of the molecular basis of functional shifts in opsin spectral sensitivities has been biased toward research primarily in vertebrates. This has restricted our ability to address whether invertebrate G protein-coupled opsins function in a novel or convergent way compared to vertebrate G opsins. Here we develop a robust heterologous expression system to purify invertebrate rhodopsins, identify specific amino acid changes responsible for adaptive spectral tuning, and pinpoint how molecular variation in invertebrate opsins underlie wavelength sensitivity shifts that enhance visual perception. By combining functional and optophysiological approaches, we disentangle the relative contributions of lateral filtering pigments from red-shifted LW and blue short-wavelength opsins expressed in distinct photoreceptor cells of individual ommatidia. We use in situ hybridization to visualize six ommatidial classes in the compound eye of a lycaenid butterfly with a four-opsin visual system. We show experimentally that certain key tuning residues underlying green spectral shifts in blue opsin paralogs have evolved repeatedly among short-wavelength opsin lineages. Taken together, our results demonstrate the interplay between regulatory and adaptive evolution at multiple G opsin loci, as well as how coordinated spectral shifts in LW and blue opsins can act together to enhance insect spectral sensitivity at blue and red wavelengths for visual performance adaptation.",

It is fast emerging as an important target for the development of therapeutic engineered bacteria, benefiting from the wealth of knowledge of  biology and ease of manipulation. Bacterial synthetic biology projects commonly utilize engineered plasmid vectors, which are simple to engineer and can reliably achieve high levels of protein expression. However, plasmids typically require antibiotics for maintenance, and the administration of an antibiotic is often incompatible with  experimentation or treatment. EcN natively contains plasmids pMUT1 and pMUT2, which have no known function but are stable within the bacteria. Here, we describe the development of the pMUT plasmids into a robust platform for engineering EcN for  experimentation, alongside a CRISPR-Cas9 system to remove the native plasmids. We systematically engineered both pMUT plasmids to contain selection markers, fluorescent markers, temperature sensitive expression, and curli secretion systems to export a customizable functional material into the extracellular space. We then demonstrate that the engineered plasmids were maintained in bacteria as the engineered bacteria pass through the mouse GI tract without selection, and that the secretion system remains functional, exporting functionalized curli proteins into the gut. Our plasmid system presents a platform for the rapid development of therapeutic EcN bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Danger signals, or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), instigate mitochondrial innate immune responses wherein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) functions as a key platform molecule to mediate them. The role of MAVS in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), however, has not yet been identified. Whether MAVS signalling can be modulated by currently existing drugs has also not been explored.We used an established model of pulmonary fibrosis to demonstrate that MAVS is a critical mediator of multiple DAMP signalling pathways and the consequent lung fibrosis after bleomycin-induced injury After bleomycin injury, MAVS expression was mainly observed in macrophages. Multimeric MAVS aggregation, a key event of MAVS signalling activation, was significantly increased and persisted in bleomycin-injured lungs. A proapoptotic BH3 mimetic, ABT-263, attenuated the expression of MAVS and its signalling and, consequently, the development of experimental pulmonary fibrosis. In contrast, the therapeutic effects of nintedanib and pirfenidone, two drugs approved for IPF treatment, were not related to the modulation of MAVS or its signalling. Multimeric MAVS aggregation was significantly increased in lungs from IPF patients as well.MAVS may play an important role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, and targeting MAVS with BH3 mimetics may provide a novel and much needed therapeutic strategy for IPF.",

However, we have little understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms underpinning its elaboration. The generation of new genetic material is considered a significant contributor to the evolution of biological novelty. We sought to understand if this mechanism may be contributing to cephalopod-specific visual system novelties. Specifically, we identified duplications in the Krüppel-like factor/specificity protein (KLF/SP) sub-family of C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factors in the squid . We cloned and analysed gene expression of the KLF/SP family, including two paralogs of the  gene. These duplicates showed overlapping expression domains but one paralog showed unique expression in the developing squid lens, suggesting a neofunctionalization of . To better understand this neofunctionalization, we performed a thorough phylogenetic analysis of SP6-9 orthologues in the Spiralia. We find multiple duplications and losses of the  gene throughout spiralian lineages and at least one cephalopod-specific duplication. This work supports the hypothesis that gene duplication and neofunctionalization contribute to novel traits like the cephalopod image-forming eye and to the diversity found within Spiralia.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder emerges from the complex interactions of biological systems that span genes and molecules through cells, networks, and behavior. Establishing how neurobiological processes coalesce to contribute to depression requires a multiscale approach, encompassing measures of brain structure and function as well as genetic and cell-specific transcriptional data. Here, we examine anatomical (cortical thickness) and functional (functional variability, global brain connectivity) correlates of depression and negative affect across three population-imaging datasets: UK Biobank, Brain Genomics Superstruct Project, and Enhancing NeuroImaging through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA; combined  ≥ 23,723). Integrative analyses incorporate measures of cortical gene expression, postmortem patient transcriptional data, depression genome-wide association study (GWAS), and single-cell gene transcription. Neuroimaging correlates of depression and negative affect were consistent across three independent datasets. Linking ex vivo gene down-regulation with in vivo neuroimaging, we find that transcriptional correlates of depression imaging phenotypes track gene down-regulation in postmortem cortical samples of patients with depression. Integrated analysis of single-cell and Allen Human Brain Atlas expression data reveal somatostatin interneurons and astrocytes to be consistent cell associates of depression, through both in vivo imaging and ex vivo cortical gene dysregulation. Providing converging evidence for these observations, GWAS-derived polygenic risk for depression was enriched for genes expressed in interneurons, but not glia. Underscoring the translational potential of multiscale approaches, the transcriptional correlates of depression-linked brain function and structure were enriched for disorder-relevant molecular pathways. These findings bridge levels to connect specific genes, cell classes, and biological pathways to in vivo imaging correlates of depression.",

While the molecular mechanisms underlying parental effects or inheritance of behavioral traits have been studied under several environmental conditions, it remains largely unexplored how the nature of parental experience affects the information transferred to the next generation. To address this question, we used , a nematode that feeds on bacteria in its habitat. Some of these bacteria are pathogenic and the worm learns to avoid them after a brief exposure. We found, unexpectedly, that a short parental experience increased the preference for the pathogen in the progeny. Furthermore, increasing the duration of parental exposure switched the response of the progeny from attraction to avoidance. To characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms, we found that the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) RRF-3, required for the biogenesis of 26 G endo-siRNAs, regulated both types of intergenerational effects. Together, we show that different parental experiences with the same environmental stimulus generate different effects on the behavior of the progeny through small RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression.",

    "title": "Loss of the Nuclear Protein RTF2 Enhances Influenza Virus Replication.",
    "abstract": "While hundreds of genes are induced by type I interferons, their roles in restricting the influenza virus life cycle remain mostly unknown. Using a loss-of-function CRISPR screen in cells prestimulated with interferon beta (IFN-β), we identified a small number of factors required for restricting influenza A virus replication. In addition to known components of the interferon signaling pathway, we found that replication termination factor 2 (RTF2) restricts influenza virus at the nuclear stage (and perhaps other stages) of the viral life cycle, based on several lines of evidence. First, a deficiency in RTF2 leads to higher levels of viral primary transcription, even in the presence of cycloheximide to block genome replication and secondary transcription. Second, cells that lack RTF2 have enhanced activity of a viral reporter that depends solely on four viral proteins that carry out replication and transcription in the nucleus. Third, when the RTF2 protein is mislocalized outside the nucleus, it is not able to restrict replication. Finally, the absence of RTF2 leads not only to enhanced viral transcription but also to reduced expression of antiviral factors in response to interferon. RTF2 thus inhibits primary influenza virus transcription, likely acts in the nucleus, and contributes to the upregulation of antiviral effectors in response to type I interferons. Viral infection triggers the secretion of type I interferons, which in turn induce the expression of hundreds of antiviral genes. However, the roles of these induced genes in controlling viral infections remain largely unknown, limiting our ability to develop host-based antiviral therapeutics against pathogenic viruses, such as influenza virus. Here, we performed a loss-of-function genetic CRISPR screen in cells prestimulated with type I interferon to identify antiviral genes that restrict influenza A virus replication. Besides finding key components of the interferon signaling pathway, we discovered a new restriction factor, RTF2, which acts in the nucleus, restricts influenza virus transcription, and contributes to the interferon-induced upregulation of known restriction factors. Our work contributes to the field of antiviral immunology by discovering and characterizing a novel restriction factor of influenza virus and may ultimately be useful for understanding how to control a virus that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Bryozoans are a diverse phylum of marine and freshwater colonial invertebrates containing approximately 6,300 described living species. Bryozoans grow by budding new physiologically connected colony members (zooids) from a founding individual that forms from a metamorphosed larva. In some species these zooids come in different shapes and sizes and are specialized to serve different tasks within the colony. A complex interaction of genotype, environment, and developmental pathway shapes zooid fate, however, the specific mechanisms underlying the establishment of this division of labor remain unknown. Here, the first characterization of differential gene expression between polymorphic zooids of a bryozoan colony is presented. The development of different zooid types of lab-cultured  colonies including feeding autozooids, avicularia (derived non-feeding zooids that are homologous to feeding autozooids but shaped like a bird's beak), and rhizoids (a branching network of non-feeding anchoring zooids) was explored using RNA sequencing,  transcriptome assembly, and differential gene expression analyses. High throughput sequencing of cDNA libraries yielded an average of 14.9 ± 1.3 (SE) million high-quality paired-end reads per sample. Data for the first  transcriptome assemblies of  and the first characterization of genes involved in the formation and maintenance of zooid types within a bryozoan colony are presented. In a comparison between autozooid and avicularium tissues, 1,097 significant differentially expressed genes were uncovered. This work provides a much-needed foundation for understanding the mechanisms involved in the development of polymorphic zooids and the establishment of division of labor in bryozoans.",

Whereas cis effects are caused by genetic variants located on the same DNA molecule as the target gene, trans effects are due to genetic variants that affect diffusible elements. Previous studies have mostly assessed the impact of cis and trans effects at the gene level. However, how cis and trans effects differentially impact regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters remains poorly understood.

Here, we leverage the sea urchin embryo for its well-established gene regulatory network to interrogate the embryo using single cell RNA sequencing. We tested eight developmental stages in , from the eight-cell stage to late in gastrulation. We used these datasets to parse out 22 major cell states of the embryo, focusing on key transition stages for cell type specification of each germ layer. Subclustering of these major embryonic domains revealed over 50 cell states with distinct transcript profiles. Furthermore, we identified the transcript profile of two cell states expressing germ cell factors, one we conclude represents the primordial germ cells and the other state is transiently present during gastrulation. We hypothesize that these cells of the Veg2 tier of the early embryo represent a lineage that converts to the germ line when the primordial germ cells are deleted. This broad resource will hopefully enable the community to identify other cell states and genes of interest to expose the underpinning of developmental mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "We have recently engineered an exosomal Tat (Exo-Tat) which can activate latent HIV-1 in resting CD4+ T lymphocytes from antiretroviral treated HIV-1 infected patients. HIV-1 Tat protein can penetrate cell membrane freely and secrete into extracellular medium. Exo-Tat loses this penetrating property. HIV-1 Tat protein can damage the synaptic membranes contributing to the development of dementia in HIV-1 infected patients. To investigate whether the penetrating property attributes to synaptic damage in vivo, we have generated adeno-associated viruses AAV-Tat and AAV-Exo-Tat viruses. Vehicle control or AAV viruses (1 × 10GC/mouse in 200 μl PBS) were injected into Balb/cj mice via tail veins. The mRNA and protein expression levels in blood, brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, muscle and spleen were determined on day 21. Intravenously injected AAV-Tat or AAV-Exo-Tat mainly infects liver and heart. Short-term expression of Tat or Exo-Tat doesn't change the expression levels of neuronal cytoskeletal marker β3-tubulin and synaptic marker postsynaptic density 95 protein (PSD-95). Wild-type Tat, but not Exo-Tat, reduces the expression level of synaptic marker synaptophysin significantly in mice, indicating that penetrating property of HIV-1 Tat protein attributes to synaptic damage.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow transplantation therapy relies on the life-long regenerative capacity of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs present a complex variety of regenerative behaviours at the clonal level, but the mechanisms underlying this diversity are still undetermined. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed transcriptional differences among HSCs, providing a possible explanation for their functional heterogeneity. However, the destructive nature of sequencing assays prevents simultaneous observation of stem cell state and function. To solve this challenge, we implemented expressible lentiviral barcoding, which enabled simultaneous analysis of lineages and transcriptomes from single adult HSCs and their clonal trajectories during long-term bone marrow reconstitution. Analysis of differential gene expression between clones with distinct behaviour revealed an intrinsic molecular signature that characterizes functional long-term repopulating HSCs. Probing this signature through in vivo CRISPR screening, we found the transcription factor TCF15 to be required and sufficient to drive HSC quiescence and long-term self-renewal. In situ, Tcf15 expression labels the most primitive subset of true multipotent HSCs. In conclusion, our work elucidates clone-intrinsic molecular programmes associated with functional stem cell heterogeneity and identifies a mechanism for the maintenance of the self-renewing HSC state.",

    "abstract": "Cells must couple cell-cycle progress to their growth rate to restrict the spread of cell sizes present throughout a population. Linear, rather than exponential, accumulation of Whi5, was proposed to provide this coordination by causing a higher Whi5 concentration in cells born at a smaller size. We tested this model using the inducible  promoter to make the Whi5 concentration independent of cell size. At an expression level that equalizes the mean cell size with that of wild-type cells, the size distributions of cells with galactose-induced Whi5 expression and wild-type cells are indistinguishable. Fluorescence microscopy confirms that the endogenous and  promoters produce different relationships between Whi5 concentration and cell volume without diminishing size control in the G1 phase. We also expressed Cln3 from the GAL1 promoter, finding that the spread in cell sizes for an asynchronous population is unaffected by this perturbation. Our findings indicate that size control in budding yeast does not fundamentally originate from the linear accumulation of Whi5, contradicting a previous claim and demonstrating the need for further models of cell-cycle regulation to explain how cell size controls passage through Start.",

The enzyme aspartate beta-hydroxylase (ASPH) has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in cholangiocarcinoma but not in normal bile ducts and found to stimulate tumor cell migration. In addition, it was found that targeting ASPH inhibits cholangiocarcinoma malignant progression. However, it is not clear whether targeting ASPH with the small molecule inhibitor MO-I-1182 suppresses cholangiocarcinoma metastasis. The current study aims to study the efficacy of MO-I-1182 in suppressing cholangiocarcinoma metastasis.",

However, in many cases (e.g., with Illumina NextSeq and NovaSeq instruments), shorter paired-end reads and longer single-end reads can be generated for the same cost, and it is not obvious which strategy should be preferred. Using publicly available data, we test whether short-paired end reads can achieve more robust expression estimates and differential expression results than single-end reads of approximately the same total number of sequenced bases.",

    "abstract": "While the basic mechanisms of flavivirus entry and fusion are understood, little is known about the postfusion events that precede RNA replication, such as nucleocapsid disassembly. We describe here a sensitive, conditionally replication-defective yellow fever virus (YFV) entry reporter, YFVΔSK/Nluc, to quantitively monitor the translation of incoming, virus particle-delivered genomes. We validated that YFVΔSK/Nluc gene expression can be neutralized by YFV-specific antisera and requires known flavivirus entry pathways and cellular factors, including clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis, endosomal acidification, YFV E glycoprotein-mediated fusion, and cellular LY6E and RPLP1 expression. The initial round of YFV translation was shown to require cellular ubiquitylation, consistent with recent findings that dengue virus capsid protein must be ubiquitylated in order for nucleocapsid uncoating to occur. Importantly, translation of incoming YFV genomes also required valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a cellular ATPase that unfolds and extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from large complexes. RNA transfection and washout experiments showed that VCP/p97 functions at a postfusion, pretranslation step in YFV entry. Finally, VCP/p97 activity was required by other flaviviruses in mammalian cells and by YFV in mosquito cells. Together, these data support a critical role for VCP/p97 in the disassembly of incoming flavivirus nucleocapsids during a postfusion step in virus entry. Flaviviruses are an important group of RNA viruses that cause significant human disease. The mechanisms by which flavivirus nucleocapsids are disassembled during virus entry remain unclear. Here, we used a yellow fever virus entry reporter, which expresses a sensitive reporter enzyme but does not replicate, to show that nucleocapsid disassembly requires the cellular protein-disaggregating enzyme valosin-containing protein, also known as p97.",

Unfortunately, these advances have not been translated into treatment, which relies on dose-intense cytotoxic chemotherapy. While most patients achieve long-term survival, options for relapsed/refractory disease are lacking, as Burkitt lymphoma is often excluded from clinical trials of novel approaches. The lower-intensity, dose-adjusted EPOCH plus rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) regimen constitutes a major advance allowing for treatment of older and HIV-positive patients but needs augmentation to better address the central nervous system involvement. Furthermore, DA-EPOCH-R provides a platform for the study of targeted or immunotherapeutic approaches while de-escalating cytotoxic agents and their associated adverse effects. In this review we discuss the epidemiology and molecular genetics of BL, first-line treatment considerations, and potential novel treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "For more than 225 million y, all seed plants were woody trees, shrubs, or vines. Shortly after the origin of angiosperms ∼140 million y ago (MYA), the Nymphaeales (water lilies) became one of the first lineages to deviate from their ancestral, woody habit by losing the vascular cambium, the meristematic population of cells that produces secondary xylem (wood) and phloem. Many of the genes and gene families that regulate differentiation of secondary tissues also regulate the differentiation of primary xylem and phloem, which are produced by apical meristems and retained in nearly all seed plants. Here, we sequenced and assembled a draft genome of the water lily , an emerging system for the study of early flowering plant evolution, and compared it to genomes from other cambium-bearing and cambium-less lineages (e.g., monocots and ). This revealed lineage-specific patterns of gene loss and divergence.  is characterized by a significant contraction of the HD-ZIP III transcription factors, specifically loss of , which influences cambial activity in other angiosperms. We also found the  and monocot copies of cambium-associated CLE signaling peptides display unique substitutions at otherwise highly conserved amino acids.  displays no obvious divergence in cambium-associated genes. The divergent genomic signatures of convergent loss of vascular cambium reveals that even pleiotropic genes can exhibit unique divergence patterns in association with independent events of trait loss. Our results shed light on the evolution of herbaceousness-one of the key biological innovations associated with the earliest phases of angiosperm evolution.",

    "abstract": "The availability of nucleotides has a direct impact on transcription. The inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) with leflunomide impacts nucleotide pools by reducing pyrimidine levels. Leflunomide abrogates the effective transcription elongation of genes required for neural crest development and melanoma growth in vivo. To define the mechanism of action, we undertook an in vivo chemical suppressor screen for restoration of neural crest after leflunomide treatment. Surprisingly, we found that alterations in progesterone and progesterone receptor (Pgr) signalling strongly suppressed leflunomide-mediated neural crest effects in zebrafish. In addition, progesterone bypasses the transcriptional elongation block resulting from Paf complex deficiency, rescuing neural crest defects in ctr9 morphant and paf1(aln) mutant embryos. Using proteomics, we found that Pgr binds the RNA helicase protein Ddx21. ddx21-deficient zebrafish show resistance to leflunomide-induced stress. At a molecular level, nucleotide depletion reduced the chromatin occupancy of DDX21 in human A375 melanoma cells. Nucleotide supplementation reversed the gene expression signature and DDX21 occupancy changes prompted by leflunomide. Together, our results show that DDX21 acts as a sensor and mediator of transcription during nucleotide stress.",

The mechanisms governing alternative splicing are known for relatively few genes and typically focus on RNA splicing factors. In sensory neurons, cell-specific alternative splicing of the presynaptic Ca channel  gene modulates opioid sensitivity. How this splicing is regulated is unknown. We find that cell and exon-specific DNA hypomethylation permits CTCF binding, the master regulator of mammalian chromatin structure, which, in turn, controls splicing in a DRG-derived cell line. , hypomethylation of an alternative exon specifically in nociceptors, likely permits CTCF binding and expression of Ca2.2 channel isoforms with increased opioid sensitivity in mice.

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a current and expanding threat to the practice of modern medicine. Antibiotic therapy has been shown to perturb the composition of the host microbiome with significant health consequences. In addition, the gut microbiome is known to be a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes. Work has demonstrated that antibiotics can alter the collection of antibiotic resistance genes within the microbiome through selection and horizontal gene transfer. While antibiotics also have the potential to impact the expression of resistance genes, metagenomic-based pipelines currently lack the ability to detect these shifts. Here, we utilized a dual sequencing approach combining shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to profile how three antibiotics, amoxicillin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin, impact the murine gut resistome at the DNA and RNA level. We found that each antibiotic induced broad, but untargeted impacts on the gene content of the resistome. In contrast, changes in ARG transcript abundance were more targeted to the antibiotic treatment. Doxycycline and amoxicillin induced the expression of tetracycline and beta-lactamase resistance genes, respectively. Furthermore, the increased beta-lactamase resistance gene transcripts could contribute to an observed bloom of  during amoxicillin treatment. Based on these findings, we propose that the utilization of a dual sequencing methodology provides a unique capacity to fully understand the response of the resistome to antibiotic perturbation. In particular, the analysis of transcripts reveals that the expression and utilization of resistance genes is far narrower than their abundance at the genomic level would suggest.",

The distance between the rotation axis and the track (90 nm) was determined after adding a Cy3 label for SprB. A rotary motor spinning a pinion of radius 90 nm at 3 Hz would cause a spot on its periphery to move at 1.5 μm/s, the gliding speed. We suggest the pinion drives a flexible tread that carries SprB along a track fixed to the cell surface. Cells glide when this adhesin adheres to the solid substratum.",

In  mutant axolotls, we found that DNA damage signaling through the H2AX histone variant was deregulated, especially within the proliferating progenitors during limb regeneration. Ultimately, cell cycle progression was impaired at the G1/S and G2/M transitions and regeneration rate was reduced. Similar data were acquired using acute pharmacological inhibition of the Eya2 phosphatase activity and the DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 in wild-type axolotls. Together, our data indicate that highly-regenerative animals employ a robust DNA damage response pathway which involves regulation of H2AX phosphorylation via Eya2 to facilitate proper cell cycle progression upon injury.",

Here, we discover that in individual  cells, flagellar promoters are stochastically activated in pulses. These pulses are coordinated within specific classes of promoters and comprise \"on\" and \"off\" states, each of which can span multiple generations. We demonstrate that in this pulsing program, the regulatory logic of flagellar assembly dictates which promoters skip pulses. Surprisingly, pulses do not require specific transcriptional or translational regulation of the flagellar master regulator, FlhDC, but instead appears to be essentially governed by an autonomous posttranslational circuit. Our results suggest that even topologically simple transcriptional networks can generate unexpectedly rich temporal dynamics and phenotypic heterogeneities.",

During oogenesis,  oocytes grow dramatically in size, with a mature oocyte having a diameter of ∼1.3 mm, and become highly polarized, localizing many mRNAs and proteins. Thus, the mature oocyte is a repository of maternal mRNAs and proteins that will direct early embryogenesis prior to zygotic genome transcription. Importantly, the  oocyte also has the capacity to translate exogenous microinjected RNAs, which has enabled breakthroughs in a wide range of areas including cell biology, developmental biology, molecular biology, and physiology. This introduction outlines how  oocytes can be used to study a variety of important biological questions.",

    "title": "The Unique Antimicrobial Recognition and Signaling Pathways in Tardigrades with a Comparison Across Ecdysozoa.",
    "abstract": "Tardigrades are microscopic animals known to withstand unfavorable abiotic conditions. These animals are also constantly exposed to biotic stresses, including parasites and internal microbiomes. However, the tardigrade immune mechanisms against these biotic stresses are largely uncharacterized. Due to the contentious phylogenetic position of tardigrades, it is not intuitive whether they possess an immune system more similar to that of arthropods (, Toll, Imd, and JNK pathways of the  antimicrobial response) or to that of nematodes (, the Tir-1/Nsy-1/Sek-1/Pmk-1/Atf-7 signaling cassette [called Tir-1 pathway here]) in ). In this study, comparative genomic analyses were conducted to mine homologs of canonical  and  immune pathway genes from eight tardigrades ( cf. , , , , , ,  cf. , and ) and four non-arthropod ecdysozoans (two onychophorans:  sp. and ; one nematomorph: ; and one priapulan: ) in order to provide insights into the tardigrade antimicrobial system. No homologs of the intracellular components of the Toll pathway were detected in any of the tardigrades examined. Likewise, no homologs of most of the Imd pathway genes were detected in any of the tardigrades or any of the other non-arthropod ecdysozoans. Both the JNK and Tir-1 pathways, on the other hand, were found to be conserved across ecdysozoans. Interestingly, tardigrades had no detectable homologs of , the major activator of antimicrobial response gene expression. Instead, tardigrades appear to possess  distantly related  homologs. Overall, our results show that tardigrades have a unique gene pathway repertoire that differs from that of other ecdysozoans. Our study also provides a framework for future studies on tardigrade immune responses.",

Yet little is known about the roles of the early wound epidermis during the initiation of regeneration and the mechanisms governing its development into the apical epithelial cap (AEC), a signaling structure necessary for outgrowth and patterning of the regenerate. Here, we elucidate the functions of the early wound epidermis, and further reveal  () as a dual regulator of both AEC development and inflammation during the initiation of axolotl limb regeneration. Through loss- and gain-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that  acts as both a critical survival signal to control the expansion and function of the early wound epidermis and an anti-inflammatory cytokine to resolve early injury-induced inflammation. Altogether, these findings unveil one of the first identified regulators of AEC development and provide fundamental insights into early wound epidermis function, development, and the initiation of limb regeneration.",

Fluorescence microscopy and cell counting were used to visualize and quantify the extent of cell migration into scaffolds, respectively. Relative mRNA expression analysis was used to characterize the temporal effects of SDF-1 on C-PCs. Tissue reintegration experiments were conducted using cylindrical human meniscal tissue punches, which were then placed back together with an HPC scaffold embedded with C-PCs. Tensile testing was used to evaluate the extent of tissue reintegration stimulated by human mesenchymal progenitors.: C-PCs migrate into scaffolds in response to SDF-1 with the same efficiency as mesenchymal progenitors from human marrow (BM-MSCs). SDF-1 treatment of C-PCs did not significantly alter the expression of early and late stage chondrogenic differentiation genes. Scaffolds containing SDF-1 pre-conditioned C-PCs successfully adhered to fibrocartilage breaks and migrated from the scaffold into the tissue. Tensile testing demonstrated that SDF-1 preconditioned C-PCs stimulate reintegration of fibrocartilage tears.: C-PCs migrate in response to SDF-1. Exposure to SDF-1 does not significantly alter the unique mRNA profile of C-PCs that make them desirable for cartilaginous tissue repair applications. SDF-1 pretreated mesenchymal progenitors successfully disperse into injured tissues to help facilitate tissue reintegration.",
